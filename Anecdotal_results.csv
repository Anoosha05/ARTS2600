This is sad. I have many friends and family with whom I disagree politically. Refusing to engage outside of your bubble is neither healthy nor unifying. https://t.co/TtJbghRLKx,"**Yes**

The message provided is an example of an anecdotal fallacy. The speaker is using their personal experience of having friends and family with whom they disagree politically to argue against the idea of engaging with differing viewpoints. They suggest that refraining from such engagement is neither healthy nor unifying, but they do not provide broader evidence or general trends to support this claim. Instead, they rely on their own isolated experiences, which is characteristic of an anecdotal fallacy."
"@DLoesch When libs are pushing to overthrow a legally elected president, undermine our Republic and it's heritage, cram ideological perversities down our throats, and all with an air of self-righteous, moral superiority the time for engaging has passed. 1/2","No, the message provided does not contain an anecdotal fallacy. It expresses a viewpoint on political ideologies and actions, but it does not rely on a personal story or isolated case to argue against broader evidence or general trends. It is more of a general statement or opinion rather than a specific anecdote."

It appears to be a statement or argument about the legitimacy of a president and references a political figure, Kris Kobach, which is not an isolated personal story or anecdote being used to argue against broader evidence or general trends."
@caldwellrobby3 @DLoesch Or maybe the exit polls were manipulated like many of the polls which predicted an overwhelming victory for HRC.,"**Yes**

The message suggests that exit polls predicting an overwhelming victory for HRC (presumably referring to Hillary Clinton in a political context) were manipulated, based on anecdotal evidence or a personal belief. This argument does not rely on broader evidence or general trends but instead uses a specific instance (or perceived instance) to make a general claim about the integrity of exit polls. This is characteristic of an anecdotal fallacy."

We now know that vote… https://t.co/HqBT2qETaO","No, the message does not contain an Anecdotal fallacy. It is a statement questioning the meaning of the term ""purged"" in the context of voter eligibility and referencing a link for further information.

"@RobertL78 @DLoesch When I say purged , I mean . Kris kobach and 32 other gop controlled states would purge legit v… https://t.co/NZVIG4IsKE","**No**

The message provided does not contain an anecdotal fallacy. It appears to be a statement or argument related to a political issue, specifically mentioning Kris Kobach and other GOP-controlled states. There is no personal story or isolated case being used to argue against broader evidence or general trends. However, without more context, it's difficult to fully assess the argument's validity."

The message does not present a personal story or isolated case to argue against broader evidence or general trends. Instead, it raises a question about the exclusivity of voters' political affiliations and mentions evidence of fraud, which does not constitute an anecdotal fallacy."

The message does not present a personal anecdote or isolated case to argue against broader evidence or general trends. Instead, it references a specific number of cases of fraud over a certain period, which could be used to discuss the prevalence or rarity of fraud. However, without additional context or a personal story, it does not constitute an anecdotal fallacy."
"@caldwellrobby3 @DLoesch Ok. Read both conservative and liberal sources like New Rep., HuffPo, Amer. Progress Actio… https://t.co/bOIUfjZb3c","**No**

The message provided does not contain an anecdotal fallacy. It is a request for others to read both conservative and liberal sources, which suggests a desire for a more balanced understanding of different viewpoints. It does not rely on a personal story or isolated case to argue against broader evidence or general trends."

The message provided does not contain an anecdotal fallacy. It references a specific law (Republican law) and a particular issue (prohibiting preregistration for minors turning 18 at voting time), but it does not use a personal story or isolated case to argue against broader evidence or general trends. It seems to be a statement or opinion about a specific policy rather than an argument based on anecdotal evidence."
@caldwellrobby3 @DLoesch 4. Nat'l Voter ID will not disenfranchise anyone any more than requiring welfare recipient… https://t.co/Fo8WPNI7JZ,"No**

The message provided does not contain an anecdotal fallacy. It seems to be a statement or argument related to the topic of voter ID laws and their potential impact on disenfranchisement. The message does not use a personal story or isolated case to argue against broader evidence or general trends. Instead, it references a link to a documentary that used peer-reviewed data, which suggests a reliance on researched and potentially more general evidence. However, without the full context of the argument or the content of the documentary, it's not possible to definitively say whether the argument is fallacious or not. The response is based solely on the information provided in the message."
@caldwellrobby3 @DLoesch I'm a Latino of Mexican decent and don't have parience for Dems handwrining over voter ID.… https://t.co/vP4UIIRldj,"**Yes**

The message provided is an example of an anecdotal fallacy. The individual is using their personal experience and identity (being a Latino of Mexican decent) as a basis to dismiss the broader issue of voter ID laws and their implications. This argument relies on a single personal story rather than considering the wider evidence and perspectives on the topic. It generalizes the complex issue of voter ID laws based on a singular, anecdotal experience, which is not sufficient to make a comprehensive argument against the concerns raised by others."
And let’s say she’s the nominee. Elizabeth Warren will spend the first 4 minutes of every 7 minute TV interview answering the same question: “well ... WERE you dishonest about your heritage?” Rinse... repeat. https://t.co/9tvfO7M7PV,"**Yes**

The message provided is an example of an anecdotal fallacy. It references a specific instance of Elizabeth Warren allegedly spending time in TV interviews addressing questions about her heritage. The argument seems to suggest that this behavior is representative of a broader issue or trend, potentially implying that all politicians or nominees engage in this behavior. However, this is a fallacy because it uses a single, isolated case to make a generalization about a group without sufficient evidence to support such a claim."
"@JoyAnnReid 

Novel idea - She can simply admit that she lied about her heritage for financial and professional gain.

Problem solved.

EOM","No, the provided message does not contain an Anecdotal fallacy. It is a statement suggesting a solution to a problem related to someone lying about their heritage. It does not use a personal story or isolated case to argue against broader evidence or general trends."
@the_kaboom @JoyAnnReid How do you or anyone know she lied? Did something concrete come out?,"No**

The message does not contain an anecdotal fallacy. It is questioning the evidence or proof of a claim (in this case, whether someone lied or not) rather than relying on a personal story or isolated case. The user is seeking concrete evidence or information, which is a logical approach to discussing the validity of a claim."
"@andrea_4_real @JoyAnnReid 

The one primary reason would be that she has never refuted the plain accusation that she did.

EOM","No, the provided message does not contain an Anecdotal fallacy. It seems to be a statement about someone not refuting an accusation, which does not involve using a personal story or isolated case to argue against broader evidence or general trends."
"@the_kaboom @JoyAnnReid But, there's no concrete proof she's not, right?","**No**

The message does not contain an anecdotal fallacy. It raises a question about the lack of concrete proof, which is a request for evidence rather than an argument based on a personal story or isolated case. The user is seeking more information or clarification, not using a specific anecdote to argue against broader evidence or general trends."
"@andrea_4_real @the_kaboom @JoyAnnReid She claimed Native ancestry on her mother's side. I saw a post on Twitter today fr organization that researched her heritage back 6 generations, all noted at time as full white, no NA. Not sure I can find that link.","No**

The message does not contain an anecdotal fallacy. It references a specific instance of someone claiming Native ancestry and mentions a research organization that investigated the individual's heritage. The message does not use this single case to argue against broader evidence or general trends. It simply states a fact about a specific investigation and expresses uncertainty about finding the link to the research."
@CreateCivility @the_kaboom @JoyAnnReid Why are conservatives so obsessed with her heritage?,"**No**

The message does not present an anecdotal fallacy. It raises a question about conservatives' focus on a person's heritage, but it does not use a personal story or isolated case to argue against broader evidence or general trends. Instead, it seems to be prompting a discussion or opinion on a specific topic."

The message provided does not present a clear anecdotal fallacy. It seems to be a statement or opinion about conservatives' views on a specific issue (her ancestry), but it does not use a personal story or isolated case to argue against broader evidence or general trends. It lacks a specific anecdote that would be used to make a general claim, which is necessary to identify an anecdotal fallacy."
"@andrea_4_real @the_kaboom @JoyAnnReid Authenticity matters. And in politics, it's rare.","No, the message does not contain an Anecdotal fallacy. It expresses a viewpoint on the importance of authenticity in politics without relying on a personal story or isolated case to argue a point."
@CreateCivility @the_kaboom @JoyAnnReid It matters to conservatives only when it's a democrat. Wish you all would'v… https://t.co/mgzquou2TD,"**Yes**

The message suggests that the importance of civility or certain political issues is only relevant when it concerns democrats, based on a personal perspective or isolated experience. This is an anecdotal fallacy because it generalizes a viewpoint without considering broader evidence or diverse experiences across the political spectrum. It uses a personal or limited observation to argue against the value of civility in politics, which is not a sound argument without wider, empirical support."

The message provided does not contain an anecdotal fallacy. It references a discussion or debate involving specific individuals (@CreateCivility, @the_kaboom, and @JoyAnnReid) and suggests that the reader should read various tweets to understand the context.

The message does not present a specific anecdotal fallacy. The user is expressing a principle of not lumping people together, which could be related to avoiding stereotypes or generalizations. However, without a specific example of using a personal story or isolated case to argue against broader evidence or general trends, we cannot identify an anecdotal fallacy in this message."
"@CreateCivility @the_kaboom @JoyAnnReid ""Principle""!? Are you kidding me!? Conservatives are funny with their selec… https://t.co/i93SXAYrOj","**Yes**

The message provided seems to be an expression of frustration or disagreement with a particular viewpoint, likely related to political ideology. The user references ""Conservatives"" in a way that suggests a generalization based on a personal perception or isolated experience (""Are you kidding me!? Conservatives are funny with their select…""). This could be seen as an anecdotal fallacy if the user is using a personal experience or a limited set of experiences to make a broader claim about all conservatives. However, without more context, it's challenging to definitively categorize this as a fallacy. The tone and brevity of the message also make it difficult to fully assess the argument's validity."

The message provided does not contain an anecdotal fallacy. It appears to be a response to a discussion or a statement, possibly about entitlement, but there is no mention of a personal story or isolated case being used to argue against broader evidence or general trends. The content of the message is not sufficient to determine the presence of an anecdotal fallacy."
@CreateCivility @the_kaboom @JoyAnnReid Do you support Trump?,"**No**

The message does not contain an anecdotal fallacy. It is a question asking about the support for a political figure (Trump), which does not rely on a personal story or isolated case to argue against broader evidence or general trends. It is a straightforward inquiry that could be answered with either personal opinion or factual data."

The message does not present a clear example of an anecdotal fallacy. It seems to be a statement about the perception of players having personal biases, but it does not use a specific personal story or isolated case to argue against broader evidence or general trends. The message is more of a general observation rather than a fallacious argument based on anecdotal evidence."

The message provided is an example of an anecdotal fallacy. It references a single instance of Bill Clinton being voted in despite alleged misconduct, and uses that specific case to make a general statement about the integrity of the electoral process or the trustworthiness of politicians. This is a fallacy because it relies on a personal story or isolated incident to argue against broader evidence or general trends, without considering the larger context or statistical data."
"Emotionally he's a mess. But politically he's in control, The media has spent weeks focusing on sexual misconduct (other than his). Meanwhile he guts the CFPB and net neutrality. Senate poised to pass an awful tax bill. Then confirm some judges. Wake up!
https://t.co/9yLxMxnOqo","**Yes**

The message provided is an example of an anecdotal fallacy. The speaker is using a single individual's (presumably a political figure's) emotional state and selective media coverage to argue against the broader political actions and decisions, such as gutting the CFPB (Consumer Financial Protection Bureau), net neutrality, passing a tax bill, and confirming judges. The argument relies on a personal anecdote about the individual's emotional state and media portrayal rather than addressing the merits or drawbacks of the political actions themselves. This oversimplification and reliance on a specific case to make a general argument is characteristic of an anecdotal fallacy."

It expresses a general concern about the state of the Republic and does not rely on a personal story or isolated case to argue against broader evidence or general trends."

People aren't acting on behalf of the media or on behalf of minorities because these attacks don't directly affect them or because they seem abstract.,"No, the message does not contain an Anecdotal fallacy. It is making a general statement about people's actions and motivations, rather than relying on a specific personal story or isolated case."
"@Pete_Rudkins @RWPUSA That sounds very flowery, but the reality is we are ineffective as we are at this moment in time. The Republic is in the hands of the few with great wealth. The rest of us have been reduced to mere surfs in a fiefdom of corruption.","**Yes**

The message provided contains an anecdotal fallacy. The speaker is using a broad, generalized statement about the current state of the Republic and the influence of wealth on politics without providing specific, isolated examples or data to support the claim. The statement implies a sweeping conclusion about the entire political system based on a perceived reality, which is characteristic of an anecdotal fallacy. The lack of concrete evidence or personal stories to illustrate the point further confirms the fallacy."
"@BlueHenArt @RWPUSA This is going to sound extreme, but it isn't. You are living in history right now. It requires historical action: mass demonstrations, walk outs, boycotts, etc....","**No**

The message provided does not contain an anecdotal fallacy. It is expressing a viewpoint on the need for historical action in response to current events, and it does not rely on a personal story or isolated case to argue against broader evidence or general trends. Instead, it seems to be advocating for collective action based on the perceived historical significance of the situation."

It references a general situation about unions and their influence on political actions like walkouts and general strikes. It does not rely on a personal story or isolated case to argue against broader evidence or general trends."
@Pete_Rudkins @LauraVanVleet @BlueHenArt @RWPUSA exactly - isn't it time we all came together?,"**No**

The message does not contain an anecdotal fallacy. It is a call for unity and does not rely on a personal story or isolated case to argue against broader evidence or general trends. Instead, it seems to be a general statement or opinion without specific anecdotal evidence."
@jj5barry @Pete_Rudkins @LauraVanVleet @RWPUSA YES! Trump is losing it. It is time to get him removed from office.,"No, the message does not contain an Anecdotal fallacy. The statement is expressing an opinion about a political figure and a call to action, but it does not use a personal story or isolated case to argue against broader evidence or general trends."
"Zero tolerance means consequences – for everyone.  No matter your contribution to our country, you do not get a pass to harass or discriminate.","No, the message does not contain an Anecdotal fallacy. It is presenting a general principle (zero tolerance for harassment or discrimination) without relying on a specific, isolated example or personal story."
"@NancyPelosi Then, in that regard, you should be calling for and endorsing the #Impeachment of trump! He's a bigot accused of violating at least 16 women! It's abhorrent that you are not calling for trump's removal! #ImpeachTrump #RESIST","**No**

The message provided does not contain an anecdotal fallacy. It is a statement expressing a viewpoint on a political issue, specifically the impeachment of a political figure based on accusations and actions. The argument is not based on a personal story or isolated case but rather on a broader political context and alleged facts. However, it's important to note that the validity of the argument would depend on the veracity of the claims made (e.g., the number of accusations and their legitimacy)."

The user is expressing a personal opinion or frustration about perceived communication habits of certain individuals, but they are not using a single story or isolated case to argue against broader evidence or general trends."
@Uberficker @NancyPelosi Have you checked your grammar?,"**No**

The message does not contain an anecdotal fallacy. It is a question directed at two individuals, asking if they have checked their grammar. There is no use of a personal story or isolated case to argue against broader evidence or general trends."
@keysdiver76 @NancyPelosi You're right. I'm sorry about that... I've completely changed my mind. I'll support trump now... what was I thinking this was twitter or something?,"**Yes**

The message contains an anecdotal fallacy because the individual is using a personal change of opinion (presumably influenced by a recent event or interaction on Twitter) as a basis to support a political stance (supporting Trump). This is a fallacy because it relies on a single, possibly emotional or impulsive, personal experience rather than a comprehensive analysis of evidence or broader trends. The change of opinion does not necessarily reflect a well-reasoned or informed decision."
@Uberficker @NancyPelosi You called it,"No, the provided message snippet does not contain an Anecdotal Fallacy. It is a statement directed at two individuals, presumably in a discussion or argument, but it does not reference a personal story or isolated case to argue against broader evidence or general trends. More context would be needed to fully assess the content of the message."
@keysdiver76 @NancyPelosi Well good luck to ya Brian. I hope you change your mind some day.,"**No**

The message does not contain an anecdotal fallacy. It is a personal statement expressing hope that someone (presumably a political figure like Nancy Pelosi) might change their mind in the future. It does not use a personal story or isolated case to argue against broader evidence or general trends."
"@Uberficker @NancyPelosi I did, being a liberal was a miserable period in my life, backatcha!","**Yes**

The message contains an anecdotal fallacy because the individual is using their personal experience of being a liberal as evidence to support a general claim about the supposed misery of being a liberal. This personal story is being used to argue against a broader perspective or general trend without considering a wider range of experiences or data. It's important to note that one person's experience does not represent the entirety of the experience of all liberals."
@keysdiver76 @NancyPelosi I don't think it's possible to be a liberal &amp; then a trump supporter.... not really. Maybe you never were one.,"**Yes**

The message provided is an example of an anecdotal fallacy. The speaker is making a generalization about liberals and their political beliefs based on a single, isolated case or personal experience. They are using their perception of Nancy Pelosi's political stance to argue against the possibility of a liberal supporting Donald Trump, without considering broader evidence or acknowledging the diversity of political beliefs within any group. This oversimplification and reliance on a personal anecdote to make a sweeping claim is characteristic of the anecdotal fallacy."
"@Uberficker @NancyPelosi And never forget, Trump won blue states, so your comment is really irrelevant","**No**

The message does not contain an anecdotal fallacy. It is a statement about a political event (Trump winning blue states) and a comment on the relevance of an opinion in that context. It does not use a personal story or isolated case to argue against broader evidence or general trends. However, it could be seen as a hasty generalization or a red herring fallacy, as it dismisses a comment without addressing its content and implies that the comment's relevance is solely determined by the outcome of a single election."
@keysdiver76 @NancyPelosi I think a lot of people made a bad choice they wish they could take back but a vote does not equal a committed supporter and his approval rating is pretty clear about that.,"**No**

The message does not contain an anecdotal fallacy. It is a statement about people's choices and approval ratings, which could be based on data or general trends rather than a specific personal story or isolated case. The message discusses the concept of voting and approval ratings in a general sense, without relying on a single anecdote to make a broader argument."

The message provided does not contain an anecdotal fallacy. It references polling data and political outcomes, which are based on statistical evidence rather than a personal story or isolated case. The message seems to be discussing the reliability of polls and the potential impact of votes from a particular political group on an election outcome, which is a matter of political analysis rather than anecdotal evidence."
"@keysdiver76 @Uberficker @NancyPelosi There is absolutely no way in hell all of tge polls were wrong.

It presents a claim about electronic voting systems and a political figure (Trump) without relying on a personal story or isolated case.

Instead, they are questioning the source of the knowledge presented by others, which is a call for evidence or credibility rather than an appeal to a specific anecdote."

The provided message does not contain an anecdotal fallacy. It appears to be a reference to a tweet or a URL, which lacks context or a personal story being used to argue against broader evidence or general trends. To properly assess for an anecdotal fallacy, there would need to be a narrative or argument presented that relies on a specific, isolated example rather than comprehensive data or evidence."
@keysdiver76 @PeachyAmerican @NancyPelosi This is over a year old.,"**No**

The message provided does not contain an anecdotal fallacy. It references a time frame (""over a year old"") and mentions specific usernames, but it does not present a personal story or isolated case to argue against broader evidence or general trends. Without additional context or a specific claim being made based on a personal anecdote, there is no fallacy present in the given message."
"@Uberficker @PeachyAmerican @NancyPelosi Getting old for sure, 7 more years of anger","**Yes**

The message provided is an example of an anecdotal fallacy. The user is making a general statement about aging leading to anger, based on their personal experience or observation of three individuals (presumably public figures, given the usernames). This is a fallacy because it uses a small, non-representative sample to make a broad generalization about the aging process and emotional states, without considering a wider range of evidence or experiences."
@keysdiver76 @PeachyAmerican @NancyPelosi I been angry about a lot of things for a long time... now it's just a tool that works a lil better. 😀,"**No**

The message provided does not contain an anecdotal fallacy. The user is sharing a personal feeling of anger and stating that it has become a more effective tool for them, which is a subjective statement about their own experience. There is no attempt to generalize this experience to a broader population or to argue against general evidence or trends based on a single story or isolated case."
@Uberficker @PeachyAmerican @NancyPelosi Why I gave up Liberalism,"**Yes**

The message provided is an example of an anecdotal fallacy. The individual is sharing a personal decision to give up liberalism, which is a political ideology, based on their individual experience or perhaps a few instances they've encountered. This personal story is being used to make a general statement about liberalism as a whole, which is not supported by broader evidence or data. The message does not provide a comprehensive analysis or consider the diversity of opinions and experiences within the liberal political spectrum. It relies on a singular, subjective experience to argue against a complex and multifaceted ideology."
@keysdiver76 @PeachyAmerican @NancyPelosi So you just decided to up and support a bigot?,"**Yes**

The message provided is an example of an anecdotal fallacy. The user is making a sweeping generalization about a group of people (in this case, presumably politicians like Nancy Pelosi) based on a single action or decision of an individual or a few individuals. This is a fallacy because it does not consider the broader context or evidence and instead relies on a personal story or isolated incident to make a general claim. It's also an ad hominem attack, which is another logical fallacy, as it attacks the character of the individuals rather than addressing the argument or issue at hand."
"@Uberficker @PeachyAmerican @NancyPelosi You never answered me, where did I say I was a trump supporter?","**No**

The message does not contain an anecdotal fallacy. It is a question seeking clarification about a previous statement or claim regarding political support. It does not use a personal story or isolated case to argue against broader evidence or general trends."
@keysdiver76 @PeachyAmerican @NancyPelosi You're confused I think. I don't care.,"**No**

@Uberficker @PeachyAmerican @NancyPelosi That's the another reason for giving up liberalism,"**Yes**

The message provided suggests that the speaker is using a personal or subjective viewpoint (""That's the another reason for giving up liberalism"") to argue against a broader political ideology (liberalism). This implies that their personal experience or belief is being used to generalize or dismiss a complex political system, which is characteristic of an anecdotal fallacy. The message does not provide evidence or a broader context to support the claim, relying instead on a personal stance."
@keysdiver76 @PeachyAmerican @NancyPelosi See these statements are broad generalizations that are absolutely foreign. They don't really assert anything.,"No, the message does not contain an Anecdotal fallacy. The user is critiquing broad generalizations and asserting that they don't make meaningful statements, rather than relying on a personal story or isolated case to argue a point."
"@Uberficker @PeachyAmerican @NancyPelosi Your original tweet stood for nothing except your own hate and anger, can't assert anything to such a statement except humor","**No**

The message provided does not contain an anecdotal fallacy. It criticizes the original tweet for being driven by hate and anger and suggests that it lacks substance. The message does not use a personal story or a single case to argue against broader evidence or general trends. Instead, it is a commentary on the perceived intentions behind a specific tweet."
"@keysdiver76 @PeachyAmerican @NancyPelosi trump's a bigot, sexual predator and traitor. Those are worth hate and anger and I like that about me. I fuckin kick ass! 😀","**Yes**

The message provided is an example of an anecdotal fallacy. The individual is making a sweeping generalization about former President Trump, labeling him as a ""bigot, sexual predator, and traitor,"" based on their personal feelings of anger and a sense of personal strength or righteousness. This statement does not rely on broader evidence or general trends but rather on a personal emotional reaction and subjective viewpoint. It is an attempt to persuade others by using a personal narrative rather than factual evidence or logical argumentation."
"@Uberficker @PeachyAmerican @NancyPelosi I'm very pleased you're happy being miserable, hateful and obsessed","**Yes**

The message provided contains an anecdotal fallacy. It generalizes the behavior and attitudes of three individuals (@Uberficker, @PeachyAmerican, @NancyPelosi) based on a personal opinion (""I'm very pleased you're happy being miserable, hateful and obsessed""). This statement does not consider broader evidence or general trends and instead relies on a subjective and isolated viewpoint to make a sweeping judgment about these individuals. It's also disrespectful and lacks a logical argument, which further indicates the use of anecdotal evidence to make a fallacious point."
@keysdiver76 @PeachyAmerican @NancyPelosi Angry isn't the same as miserable. It's fire... it means you stand for something! that's foreign to you maybe because you've never really believed in anything?,"**No**

The message does not present an anecdotal fallacy. It is expressing an opinion about emotions and beliefs, suggesting that being angry can be a sign of standing for something, and questioning whether someone might not believe in anything due to a lack of strong convictions. It does not use a personal story or isolated case to argue against broader evidence or general trends."
"@Uberficker @keysdiver76 @NancyPelosi I have only seen your feedback since I told that guy so long, @Uberficker and am entertained.
Bless your heart for continuing to give him the time of day.","No, the message does not contain an Anecdotal fallacy. It appears to be a personal commentary on someone's continued interaction with another individual, without using a specific anecdote to argue against broader evidence or general trends."
@PeachyAmerican @keysdiver76 @NancyPelosi It was entertaining for a while.😉,"No, the message does not contain an Anecdotal fallacy. The user is simply expressing that they found something entertaining, without using a personal story or isolated case to argue against broader evidence or general trends."
@Uberficker @keysdiver76 @NancyPelosi I tend to agree with that. But I usually cut it off to try to preserve my sanity. I would like to retain my IQ and not let these idiots zap away a few points. 😂,"**No**

The message does not contain an anecdotal fallacy. The individual is sharing a personal experience of trying to maintain their sanity in the face of disagreement, but they are not using this single instance to argue against broader evidence or general trends. They are simply expressing a personal coping strategy."
"@PeachyAmerican @keysdiver76 @NancyPelosi I agree. He's still trying to communicate w me but I it got boring watching him try to mansplain and take a moral high ground... I mean, trump, hahaha... You don't come back from that.","**Yes**

The message provided contains an anecdotal fallacy. The individual is sharing a personal experience with a specific individual (presumably Donald Trump, based on the context) and generalizing that experience to suggest that no one can come back from ""that."" This is a fallacy because it uses a single, isolated incident to make a broad claim about all possible interactions with that individual, without considering broader evidence or a wider range of experiences."
@Uberficker @PeachyAmerican @NancyPelosi And your point?,"**No**

The message provided does not contain an anecdotal fallacy. It is a request for others to present their points or arguments, rather than using a personal story or isolated case to argue against broader evidence or general trends."
Short-sighted decision to keep Franken in a Senate seat that would have been filled by a Democratic appointee anyway is going to cost Doug Jones the election.,"No**

The message provided does not contain an anecdotal fallacy. It presents a specific argument about a political decision and its potential impact on an election, without relying on a personal story or isolated case. The argument is based on the premise of a political strategy and its consequences, which can be analyzed and debated with broader evidence or general trends."
@mattyglesias You can be honest. Is there a contest? How many bad takes can a journalist make in a 24 hour period? Winning isn’t important. You can stop now.,"No, the message does not contain an Anecdotal fallacy. It appears to be a question or comment directed at a specific individual (@mattyglesias) about journalistic integrity and the frequency of bad takes, without using a personal story or isolated case to argue against broader evidence or general trends."
"@Cycle4 @mattyglesias nah it must be a 48 hour competition, that explains his 'suprise' that Trump is so orthodox right wing on economics tweet from yesterday","**Yes**

The message provided is an example of an anecdotal fallacy. The user is attributing a specific political stance (orthodox right-wing on economics) to a person (Trump) based on a single instance (a tweet from two days prior). This is a fallacy because it relies on a personal anecdote (one tweet) to make a generalization about someone's political beliefs, without considering broader evidence or the complexity of political views. It also assumes that the tweet was a surprise, which is not substantiated by any broader context or data."
"@ALPLPC @mattyglesias True, true.","No, the message provided does not contain an Anecdotal fallacy. It appears to be an agreement or acknowledgment of a statement made by others, without presenting a personal story or isolated case as evidence against broader data or trends."
"@Cycle4 @mattyglesias And I forget, was it him or Chait who had the totally driven by amnesia and deliberate misstating of facts take that Bill should have resigned over Lewinskey?","**Yes**

The message provided seems to be referencing a specific incident or argument involving individuals (presumably Chait and Bill) and Lewinskey. The mention of ""totally driven by amnesia and deliberate misstating of facts"" suggests that the argument is based on a particular anecdote or isolated case rather than broader evidence or general trends. This could be seen as an example of an anecdotal fallacy if the person is using this specific instance to argue against a larger issue without sufficient evidence. However, without more context, it's challenging to fully assess the argument's validity. The key point here is that the message implies reliance on a specific story rather than a comprehensive analysis, which aligns with the characteristics of an anecdotal fallacy."
"@ALPLPC At this point, it was likely both. I’ve lost track of all the rewriters of history and common sense!","**Yes**

The message provided suggests the use of personal anecdotes or experiences (""I’ve lost track of all the rewriters of history and common sense!"") to make a broader point about historical revisionism or the distortion of common sense. This reliance on personal experience rather than systematic evidence or broader data could be seen as an anecdotal fallacy, as it may not accurately represent the general situation or trend."
"@Cycle4 All of them trying to tie Clinton/Lewinsky to this moment forget that Lewinsky was the instigator, and that Bills problem was an inability to say No, not that he was hitting on women","No, the message does not contain an Anecdotal fallacy. It is discussing a specific situation involving Lewinsky and Bill, and it seems to be making a point about responsibility and behavior. It does not use a personal story or isolated case to argue against broader evidence or general trends."
"@Cycle4 Plus it was a real relationship, ongoing for months with gifts exchanged etc, she was only an intern for the first 8 days of their relationship so should be called WH Staffer &amp; so on &amp; so on","**No**

The message provided does not contain an anecdotal fallacy. It is discussing a specific situation regarding the classification of a relationship based on the duration of an internship. The argument is not using a personal story or isolated case to argue against broader evidence or general trends. It is more of a question or a point of view on a specific scenario rather than a generalization or fallacy."
@Cycle4 Its criminal how so many on the supposed left have swallowed and regurgitate discredited GOP Talking Points &amp; language of that time,"**Yes**

The message provided does contain an anecdotal fallacy. The user is generalizing the behavior of ""so many on the supposed left"" based on an anecdotal observation that they ""have swallowed and regurgitate discredited GOP Talking Points &amp; language of that time."" This statement relies on a personal perception or isolated examples rather than broader evidence or data to make a claim about a group's political behavior. It also implies a causal relationship without sufficient evidence to support it."
"@ALPLPC I agree. I’m old enough to have been there, and watching the rewrite has been a nightmare. I know Joe Conason tried valiantly to educate those saying stupid stuff, but I think they stuck their fingers in their ears.","**Yes**

The message contains an anecdotal fallacy because the speaker is relying on their personal experience (""I’m old enough to have been there"") and a specific instance (""watching the rewrite has been a nightmare"") to argue against a broader issue (the effectiveness of Joe Conason's efforts to educate others on a topic). The speaker dismisses the efforts of Joe Conason and others by implying that their attempts were ineffective based on their own subjective experience, which does not constitute comprehensive evidence against the broader efforts or outcomes."
"@Cycle4 The Hunting of the President was one of the most important books in forming my political (not policy) views.  The media has a lot to answer for, their failures during Whitewater directly gave us W and laid the groundwork for Trump","**Yes**

The message contains an anecdotal fallacy because it relies on a single personal experience with the book ""The Hunting of the President"" to make a broad claim about its importance in shaping political views. The message also attributes the failures of the media during the Whitewater investigation to a larger trend without providing broader evidence or considering other factors that could have influenced political views. The anecdote is used to generalize about the impact of media on political perspectives, which is not substantiated by broader evidence."
"@Cycle4 And the GOP still has never paid a price, in fact they have been rewarded for their dishonest &amp; destructive politics, its why I supported HRC in 08 with all his feelgood 'no blue or red States' stuff","**No**

The message provided does not contain an anecdotal fallacy. The user is expressing their personal political opinion and experience with the GOP (Grand Old Party, another name for the Republican Party) and their support for HRC (Hillary Clinton) in 2008. While it is a personal viewpoint, it does not use a single story or isolated case to argue against broader evidence or general trends. Instead, it reflects a political stance and a historical event. The user's statement is more about their political beliefs and actions rather than relying on anecdotal evidence."
"@ALPLPC I am ready for them to pay a price. I never thought 20 years later they would have widened their destructive path, and yet, here we are. It’s time for the pendulum to swing, and for Dems to swing back.","**No**

The message provided does not contain an anecdotal fallacy. The individual is expressing a personal viewpoint on a political issue and suggesting a change in direction for a political party (Democrats). While it is based on personal experience and opinion, it does not use a single story or isolated case to argue against broader evidence or general trends. Instead, it reflects a subjective perspective on political change. An anecdotal fallacy would require the use of a specific personal story as the sole or primary evidence for a general claim."
"@Cycle4 It needs to happen at the ballot box, they need to be electorally rejected on a massive scale repeatedly until they change, but a both-siderist balance matters more than truth media make that unlikely","**No**

The message does not present a specific anecdotal fallacy. It expresses a viewpoint on political change and the role of media in shaping public opinion. While it may imply a critique of media bias and the importance of electoral processes, it does not use a personal story or isolated case to argue against broader evidence or general trends."
"@Cycle4 Obviously I say all this in full appreciation of the fact I'm not telling u anything u don't already know, just wish more ppl knew it","**No**

The message does not contain an anecdotal fallacy. The user is not using a personal story or isolated case to argue against broader evidence or general trends. Instead, they are expressing a sentiment about the general awareness of a topic, without providing specific anecdotal evidence."
"@ALPLPC Oh, I know! It’s good to get it out- maybe someone who doesn’t know will see it and it can spark something.","No, the message does not contain an Anecdotal fallacy. It suggests that sharing information (possibly about a specific issue) could lead to awareness and potentially inspire change or discussion. It does not rely on a personal story or isolated case to argue against broader evidence or general trends."
@Cycle4 I would like that to be the case but twitter is so siloed now that you're always preaching to the choir. 1 good thing with this time is I now follow lots of never-Trump conservatives and their non-Trump policy tweets get me to confront different views,"**No**

The message does not contain an anecdotal fallacy. The user is sharing a personal experience about following different political views on Twitter, but they are not using this single instance to argue against broader evidence or general trends. Instead, they are expressing a personal observation about the current state of political discourse on the platform."
"@ALPLPC Same. I agree with Bill Kristol frequently now, and it makes me think. Which is a good thing, but also confusing. 😂😂","No, the message does not contain an Anecdotal fallacy. The user is expressing a personal change in opinion and acknowledging the complexity of the issue, but they are not using a single story or isolated case to argue against broader evidence or general trends."
"@Cycle4 Yeah, I've managed to avoid agreeing with Kristol, Mostly anyway... but Frum and scarily the old neo-cons sometimes (more often than I like tbh) say non-Trump related things I agree with which is really off-putting","**Yes**

The message contains an anecdotal fallacy because the individual is using their personal experience of occasionally agreeing with certain people (Frum and neo-cons) on non-Trump related topics to argue against the broader political stance or ideology. This isolated case is being used to generalize about the group as a whole, which is not a sound argument. The individual's agreement with some members of a group on certain issues does not negate the group's overall stance or ideology."
"@Cycle4 mind you I have never been a 'blame the west' lefty anyway, I've always thought that despite all its faults… https://t.co/zST5OjWKAY","**No**

The message does not present a clear example of an anecdotal fallacy. The user is sharing their personal perspective on a political issue and does not use a single story or isolated case to argue against broader evidence or general trends. They are not using their personal experience to dismiss or undermine a larger body of evidence or a general trend. However, it's important to note that the message is somewhat vague and lacks context, which could potentially lead to misinterpretation. But based on the given information, it does not contain an anecdotal fallacy."
