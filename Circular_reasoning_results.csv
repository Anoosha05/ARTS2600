This is sad. I have many friends and family with whom I disagree politically. Refusing to engage outside of your bubble is neither healthy nor unifying. https://t.co/TtJbghRLKx,"**No**

The message does not contain circular reasoning. It presents an argument that refusing to engage with differing political views is unhealthy and unifying, presumably because it prevents constructive dialogue and understanding. The premise and conclusion are not the same; the conclusion is not simply a restatement of the premise but rather a claim about the consequences of a certain behavior."
"@DLoesch When libs are pushing to overthrow a legally elected president, undermine our Republic and it's heritage, cram ideological perversities down our throats, and all with an air of self-righteous, moral superiority the time for engaging has passed. 1/2","**No**, the message does not contain a Circular Reasoning fallacy. The statement criticizes a group (liberals) for their actions and beliefs but does not restate the premise as the conclusion. Instead, it presents a series of claims about the group's behavior and attitudes, which are then used to justify the speaker's position that engagement with this group is no longer appropriate. The argument is not circular because it does not use its conclusion as its premise."
@RobertL78 @DLoesch Legality is question of his legitimacy as president . We already know gop with kris kobach purg… https://t.co/sXzXZE0Fwr,"**No** - The message does not contain a clear example of circular reasoning. It seems to be discussing the legitimacy of a president and mentions a political figure (Kris Kobach), but it does not restate the conclusion as the premise. The argument would need to show that the president's legitimacy is assumed in the premise and then used to support the conclusion without independent evidence, which is not evident in the provided text."
@caldwellrobby3 @DLoesch Or maybe the exit polls were manipulated like many of the polls which predicted an overwhelming victory for HRC.,"**No** - The message does not contain circular reasoning. It suggests a possibility of manipulation in exit polls and draws a parallel to other polls that predicted a different outcome. It does not restate the premise as the conclusion; instead, it presents a hypothesis about the integrity of the polls, which could be investigated further."
"@caldwellrobby3 @DLoesch You must mean by ""purged"" that those ineligible to vote were purged. We now know that vote… https://t.co/HqBT2qETaO","**No** - The message does not contain a circular reasoning fallacy. It presents a claim that ""purged"" refers to those ineligible to vote and then seeks to clarify or confirm this understanding. It does not restate the premise as the conclusion without additional support or evidence. The message appears to be part of a discussion or clarification rather than an argument that relies solely on its own assertion."
"@RobertL78 @DLoesch When I say purged , I mean . Kris kobach and 32 other gop controlled states would purge legit v… https://t.co/NZVIG4IsKE","**No**

The message does not contain a circular reasoning fallacy. It is a statement about a political action (purging) and mentions Kris Kobach and other GOP-controlled states. There is no conclusion being restated as a premise without providing independent evidence or reasoning. The message could potentially be part of a larger argument, but as presented, it does not exhibit circular reasoning."
@caldwellrobby3 @DLoesch Are you saying those voters were Dems exclusively? There is a lot of evidence of fraud lik… https://t.co/ZoChNHNMso,"**No**

The message does not contain circular reasoning. It is questioning the claim about voters being exclusively Democrats and suggesting there is evidence of fraud. The argument presented is not restating the premise as its conclusion; instead, it is challenging a statement with an implication of additional evidence."
@RobertL78 @DLoesch There is only a handful of cases of fraud in the last ten years . It’s not nearly as bad as gop… https://t.co/gwDKVeH3P7,"**No**, this message does not contain a Circular Reasoning fallacy. The statement is presenting a claim about the frequency of fraud cases and comparing it to another issue (presumably related to the GOP). It does not restate the premise as the conclusion; instead, it provides a comparison that could be argued or supported with evidence. However, the validity of the claim would depend on the evidence provided to support the frequency of fraud cases and the context of the comparison."
"@caldwellrobby3 @DLoesch Ok. Read both conservative and liberal sources like New Rep., HuffPo, Amer. Progress Actio… https://t.co/bOIUfjZb3c","**No** - The message provided does not contain a circular reasoning fallacy. It appears to be a call to action for reading both conservative and liberal sources, possibly to gain a balanced perspective on issues. The message does not restate its premise as its conclusion; instead, it suggests a course of action without making an argument that loops back on itself."
@caldwellrobby3 @DLoesch 2. Some Repub laws excessive like prohibiting prereg. for minors turning 18 at voting time… https://t.co/EhzOkTvD4u,"**No** - The message does not contain a circular reasoning fallacy. It presents a specific concern about a Republican law related to preregistration for minors turning 18 at voting time. The argument or claim is not simply restating the premise as its conclusion; instead, it is raising a potential issue with a particular policy. To determine if it's fallacious, one would need to evaluate the underlying argument about the law's impact or intent."
@caldwellrobby3 @DLoesch 4. Nat'l Voter ID will not disenfranchise anyone any more than requiring welfare recipient… https://t.co/Fo8WPNI7JZ,"**No**, this message does not contain a Circular Reasoning fallacy. The message seems to be presenting an argument or comparison between the implementation of National Voter ID laws and welfare recipient requirements. However, without the full context or the conclusion being restated as a premise, we cannot identify circular reasoning. A brief explanation would require more information about the argument being made."
@caldwellrobby3 @DLoesch I'm a Latino of Mexican decent and don't have parience for Dems handwrining over voter ID.… https://t.co/vP4UIIRldj,"**No**, the message does not contain a Circular Reasoning fallacy. The statement is expressing a personal belief or perspective about the speaker's identity and their stance on voter ID laws. It does not restate the premise as the conclusion; instead, it provides a reason (being a Latino of Mexican decent) for a particular viewpoint (not having patience for Democrats' concerns over voter ID). The argument could be critiqued for potential bias or lack of evidence, but it does not exemplify circular reasoning."
And let’s say she’s the nominee. Elizabeth Warren will spend the first 4 minutes of every 7 minute TV interview answering the same question: “well ... WERE you dishonest about your heritage?” Rinse... repeat. https://t.co/9tvfO7M7PV,"**Yes** - The message suggests that Elizabeth Warren is dishonest about her heritage because she repeats the same question in interviews. This argument assumes the conclusion (her dishonesty) is true because it restates the premise (the repetition of the question), without providing independent evidence of her dishonesty. The reasoning is circular because it uses the repeated question as a supposed proof of dishonesty, rather than presenting new information or evidence."
"@JoyAnnReid 

Novel idea - She can simply admit that she lied about her heritage for financial and professional gain.

Problem solved.

EOM","**No**, the message does not contain a Circular Reasoning fallacy. The statement suggests a solution to a problem (lying about heritage) by proposing an admission of guilt. It does not restate the premise as the conclusion; instead, it offers a potential resolution to the issue at hand. The reasoning provided is not circular but rather a direct approach to addressing the problem."
@the_kaboom @JoyAnnReid How do you or anyone know she lied? Did something concrete come out?,"No, this message does not contain a Circular Reasoning fallacy. The statement is questioning the evidence for a claim (that someone lied) rather than restating the premise as the conclusion. It implies a need for concrete evidence to support the assertion of lying, which is a call for independent verification rather than a loop of reasoning."
"@andrea_4_real @JoyAnnReid 

The one primary reason would be that she has never refuted the plain accusation that she did.

EOM","No, the provided message does not contain a Circular Reasoning fallacy. The message suggests that Andrea has not refuted an accusation, which implies a lack of evidence or defense rather than restating the premise as the conclusion. Circular reasoning would require the message to loop back to its initial claim without additional support, which is not the case here."
"@the_kaboom @JoyAnnReid But, there's no concrete proof she's not, right?","**No** - The message does not contain circular reasoning. It suggests that there is a lack of concrete proof regarding a specific claim about JoyAnnReid, which implies a need for evidence rather than restating the premise as the conclusion. The argument is inviting further information or proof, which is the opposite of circular reasoning."
"@andrea_4_real @the_kaboom @JoyAnnReid She claimed Native ancestry on her mother's side. I saw a post on Twitter today fr organization that researched her heritage back 6 generations, all noted at time as full white, no NA. Not sure I can find that link.","**No** - The message does not contain circular reasoning. The individual is discussing a claim of Native ancestry and referencing a Twitter post from an organization that researched the person's heritage. The argument is based on the existence of research and documentation, not on a premise that restates itself without independent support. The person is questioning the validity of the claim by seeking a link to the research, which implies a desire for external evidence rather than relying on a looped argument."
@CreateCivility @the_kaboom @JoyAnnReid Why are conservatives so obsessed with her heritage?,"No, this message does not contain a Circular Reasoning fallacy. The statement is questioning why conservatives might be fixated on a person's heritage, which could imply a discussion on cultural, political, or social biases. However, it does not restate its conclusion as its premise or fail to provide independent evidence. The reasoning here seems to be an opinion or a question prompting further discussion rather than a logical fallacy."

The statement is expressing an opinion about conservatives' attitudes towards a person's ancestry. It does not restate the premise as the conclusion nor does it fail to provide independent evidence. Instead, it seems to be part of a discussion or argument about political beliefs and attitudes, which would require further context or evidence to evaluate for logical fallacies."
"@andrea_4_real @the_kaboom @JoyAnnReid Authenticity matters. And in politics, it's rare.","**No** - The message does not contain a circular reasoning fallacy. It states a viewpoint that authenticity is important and implies that it is uncommon in politics. It does not restate the premise as the conclusion; instead, it provides a reason for why authenticity might be valued in politics without assuming the conclusion in the premise."

The statement suggests a political bias or opinion that conservatives only care about certain issues when they involve democrats. However, it does not restate its premise as its conclusion nor does it fail to provide independent evidence. It's more of an assertion of a political viewpoint rather than a logical fallacy."

The user is asking for clarification about a reference to ""you all,"" which indicates they are seeking additional information or context rather than restating a premise as the conclusion. There is no loop in reasoning where the conclusion is simply a restatement of the premise."

The statement provided is an expression of the speaker's principle not to generalize or lump people together based on their beliefs. It does not restate the premise as the conclusion nor does it fail to provide independent evidence for the claim. The reasoning is about the speaker's personal principle, not a logical argument that would require a restatement of the premise to support the conclusion."

The given message does not contain a circular reasoning fallacy. It appears to be a comment or opinion about conservatives, possibly criticizing their behavior or sense of humor. There is no argument presented where the conclusion is simply a restatement of the premise without providing independent evidence.

It seems to be a comment or response to a previous statement, possibly about entitlement, but without a clear premise and conclusion that restates the premise, there is no circular reasoning evident in this excerpt."
@CreateCivility @the_kaboom @JoyAnnReid Do you support Trump?,"**No** - The message does not contain a circular reasoning fallacy. It is a question asking about the support for a political figure, Trump, and does not restate the premise as the conclusion. It lacks a claim that the conclusion is merely a repetition of the premise."

The individual is stating a fact that they did not vote for a certain person but still support them, drawing a comparison to their support for Obama. There is no restatement of the premise as the conclusion; instead, it provides a reason for their support that is independent of the premise."
@CreateCivility @the_kaboom @JoyAnnReid https://t.co/zEZ14eRcuJ.  Do you still support him after reading this?,"No, this message does not contain a Circular Reasoning fallacy. The message is asking if someone still supports a person after reading a link, which does not restate the premise as its conclusion. It lacks a logical argument structure that would be necessary to identify circular reasoning."

The statement acknowledges that every player has their own perspective or ""ax to grind,"" which implies that they may have personal reasons for their viewpoints. However, it does not restate the premise as the conclusion; instead, it presents a general observation about people having their own biases or reasons for their opinions. The reasoning provided is not a loop but an acknowledgment of subjectivity in perspectives."

It states a fact that Bill Clinton was voted in, which is an event that can be verified independently of the premise. The message does not restate the premise as the conclusion; instead, it provides a historical fact that can be checked for its validity."
"Emotionally he's a mess. But politically he's in control, The media has spent weeks focusing on sexual misconduct (other than his). Meanwhile he guts the CFPB and net neutrality. Senate poised to pass an awful tax bill. Then confirm some judges. Wake up!
https://t.co/9yLxMxnOqo","**Yes** - The message contains circular reasoning by implying that the political control is valid because the media is focusing on other issues, and the issues are bad because the political figure is in control. It does not provide independent evidence for the political figure's control or the validity of the criticism; it merely restates the premise in a different form. The argument assumes that the political figure's control is inherently negative without providing external justification, thus creating a loop of reasoning."
@RWPUSA Mr. Painter...we all share in your frustration and we are awake...yet helpless. The Republic is dying.,"**No** - The message does not contain circular reasoning. It expresses a concern about the state of the Republic and acknowledges a shared feeling of frustration and helplessness. However, it does not restate its premise as its conclusion; instead, it presents an opinion or a viewpoint without providing a loop of reasoning that supports itself. To identify circular reasoning, one would need to see a statement where the conclusion is assumed in the premise without any external justification or evidence."
@BlueHenArt @RWPUSA You are only as helpless as your imagination and your will to act allow. People aren't acting on behalf of the media or on behalf of minorities because these attacks don't directly affect them or because they seem abstract.,"**No** - The message does not contain circular reasoning. It presents a claim that people's actions are influenced by their imagination and will to act, and it suggests that these actions are not motivated by media or minority issues because they don't seem directly relevant or concrete. The argument is attempting to explain a cause (imagination and will to act) for a certain effect (people's actions), rather than restating the premise as the conclusion. However, the argument could be critiqued for potential oversimplification or lack of evidence to support the claim."
"@Pete_Rudkins @RWPUSA That sounds very flowery, but the reality is we are ineffective as we are at this moment in time. The Republic is in the hands of the few with great wealth. The rest of us have been reduced to mere surfs in a fiefdom of corruption.","**Yes** - The message contains circular reasoning because it asserts that the Republic is ineffective due to being controlled by the few with great wealth, but it does not provide independent evidence or reasoning to support this claim. It merely restates the premise that the Republic is controlled by the wealthy as the reason for its ineffectiveness without offering a logical argument or factual support to demonstrate how this control directly leads to ineffectiveness. The argument assumes what it is trying to prove without providing a clear causal link or evidence."
"@BlueHenArt @RWPUSA This is going to sound extreme, but it isn't. You are living in history right now. It requires historical action: mass demonstrations, walk outs, boycotts, etc....","**No**

The message does not contain circular reasoning. It is advocating for historical action (mass demonstrations, walkouts, boycotts) as a response to current events, suggesting that these actions are necessary because of the historical context. The argument is not restating the premise as its conclusion; instead, it is providing a reason (historical context) for a specific course of action."
@Pete_Rudkins @LauraVanVleet @BlueHenArt @RWPUSA funny - your timing is impeccable https://t.co/20seTFUWBO,"**No** - The message does not contain a Circular Reasoning fallacy.

There is no restatement of a premise as the conclusion, nor is there a loop in reasoning."
"@jj5barry @LauraVanVleet @BlueHenArt @RWPUSA Something more than hoping GOP Congress acts needs to happen. So, more and more people are going to be having these conversations.","**No** - The message does not contain circular reasoning. It suggests that for GOP Congress to act, there needs to be more than just hope, and it implies that increased discussions among people could be a catalyst for action. The reasoning provided is not simply restating the premise but is suggesting a cause-and-effect relationship."
@Pete_Rudkins @LauraVanVleet @BlueHenArt @RWPUSA https://t.co/gFDdVVIKZM,"No, the provided message does not contain a Circular Reasoning fallacy. The message appears to be a series of social media handles or a link, which does not present any argument or premise that could be restated as a conclusion. Without a stated premise and conclusion, there is no logical structure to evaluate for circular reasoning."
"@jj5barry @LauraVanVleet @BlueHenArt @RWPUSA It seems because our unions have been gutted, or have been almost forgotten as political forces, we forget the power of walkouts and general strikes, whether we're in unions or not.","**No**

The message does not contain circular reasoning. It presents a cause-and-effect relationship where the decline of unions (cause) is linked to a potential forgetting of the power of walkouts and general strikes (effect). It suggests a historical context and implies a need for action (remembering the power of collective action) without restating the premise as the conclusion. The reasoning provided is not a loop but a suggestion for reflection and potential action based on past events."
@Pete_Rudkins @LauraVanVleet @BlueHenArt @RWPUSA exactly - isn't it time we all came together?,"**No** - The message does not contain a circular reasoning fallacy. It is a call for unity and collaboration among the mentioned individuals, without restating the premise as the conclusion. It lacks the structure where the conclusion is dependent on the premise without additional supportive evidence."
@jj5barry @Pete_Rudkins @LauraVanVleet @RWPUSA YES! Trump is losing it. It is time to get him removed from office.,"**No**

The given message does not contain circular reasoning. It expresses an opinion about a political figure (Trump) and suggests a course of action (removal from office) based on the perceived performance or behavior of that figure. There is no restatement of the premise as the conclusion; instead, it presents a cause-and-effect argument without looping back to the initial claim."
"Zero tolerance means consequences – for everyone.  No matter your contribution to our country, you do not get a pass to harass or discriminate.","**No** - The message does not contain circular reasoning. It is stating a principle (zero tolerance) and its application (consequences for everyone, regardless of their contribution). It does not restate the premise as the conclusion; instead, it outlines a policy or rule and its implications."
"@NancyPelosi Then, in that regard, you should be calling for and endorsing the #Impeachment of trump! He's a bigot accused of violating at least 16 women! It's abhorrent that you are not calling for trump's removal! #ImpeachTrump #RESIST","**No**, this message does not contain a Circular Reasoning fallacy. The argument presented is not restating the premise as the conclusion. Instead, it is advocating for a specific action (impeachment) based on the premise that the individual mentioned (Nancy Pelosi) should endorse it due to the alleged actions and character of another person (Trump). The reasoning provided is a call to action based on perceived wrongdoing, not a loop that restates the initial claim without independent support."
@Uberficker @NancyPelosi Triggered a bit?,**No** - The message does not contain a Circular Reasoning fallacy. It appears to be a comment or question about a specific event or action involving individuals (@Uberficker and @NancyPelosi). There is no restatement of a premise as the conclusion without independent evidence. The message lacks a logical argument structure that would be necessary to identify circular reasoning.
@keysdiver76 @NancyPelosi Are you doing that thing where you guys 'don't talk too good' so you just say the same thing over and over? Words man... use your words. Read a book. It'll help you with your... issues.,"**No** - The message does not contain circular reasoning. The speaker is not concluding that using words or reading a book will help with issues simply by restating the premise. Instead, they are suggesting that reading a book could improve one's ability to communicate effectively, which is a separate point from the premise. The advice given is based on the idea that reading can enhance language skills, not that it is true because it is true."
@Uberficker @NancyPelosi Have you checked your grammar?,"**No** - The message does not contain a Circular Reasoning fallacy. It is a question directed at two individuals, asking if they have checked their grammar. There is no restatement of a premise as the conclusion, nor is there a loop in reasoning. The statement is straightforward and seeks information rather than attempting to prove a point through circular logic."
@keysdiver76 @NancyPelosi You're right. I'm sorry about that... I've completely changed my mind. I'll support trump now... what was I thinking this was twitter or something?,"**No** - The message does not contain circular reasoning. The individual is expressing a change of opinion and stating support for a political figure (Trump), which is not restated as evidence for itself. Instead, it reflects a personal shift in viewpoint, possibly influenced by new information or persuasion, but it does not loop back to the initial premise as proof."
@Uberficker @NancyPelosi You called it,"No, the provided message does not contain a Circular Reasoning fallacy. The message is a callout to two individuals, presumably to discuss or argue about a topic. There is no argument presented or conclusion drawn that restates the premise without providing independent evidence."
@keysdiver76 @NancyPelosi Well good luck to ya Brian. I hope you change your mind some day.,"No, this message does not contain a Circular Reasoning fallacy. The statement expresses a personal opinion or wish regarding someone else's potential change of mind, without restating the premise as the conclusion. It lacks a logical loop where the conclusion is just a rephrased version of the premise."
"@Uberficker @NancyPelosi I did, being a liberal was a miserable period in my life, backatcha!","**No** - The message does not contain circular reasoning. The individual is expressing a personal opinion about their experience as a liberal, which is subjective and does not restate the premise as its conclusion. Circular reasoning would require the argument to loop back on itself without providing new information or evidence, which is not the case here."
@keysdiver76 @NancyPelosi I don't think it's possible to be a liberal &amp; then a trump supporter.... not really. Maybe you never were one.,"**No** - The message does not contain circular reasoning. The argument presented is a critique of political alignment, suggesting that it's unlikely for someone to be both liberal and a Trump supporter. It does not restate the premise as the conclusion; instead, it presents a position on political ideology and its perceived inconsistency with supporting Trump. The reasoning provided is based on the perceived ideological differences between liberals and Trump's political stance, not on a loop of restating the same idea."
"@Uberficker @NancyPelosi And never forget, Trump won blue states, so your comment is really irrelevant","**No** - The message does not contain circular reasoning. It is an assertion that Trump won blue states, implying that comments about Trump winning these states are irrelevant. The argument is not restating the premise as its conclusion; instead, it is presenting a conditional statement about the relevance of comments based on the outcome of an election. However, the validity of the argument would depend on the context and whether the premise (Trump winning blue states) logically leads to the conclusion (comments are irrelevant)."
@keysdiver76 @NancyPelosi I think a lot of people made a bad choice they wish they could take back but a vote does not equal a committed supporter and his approval rating is pretty clear about that.,"**No** - The message does not contain circular reasoning. It presents an argument that people who vote against a particular choice (presumably a political stance or policy) may not necessarily be committed supporters, as indicated by a clear approval rating. The reasoning provided is not simply restating the premise but is attempting to link voting behavior with the level of commitment, which requires independent evidence or further explanation."
"@Uberficker @NancyPelosi The same polling that gave Hillary a 98% chance of winning, he couldn't have won without votes from the left.  You're veering off course","**No** - The message does not contain circular reasoning. It presents a claim about polling data and its implications for Hillary's chances of winning, followed by a statement about the necessity of votes from the left for her victory. The argument is not restating the premise as the conclusion; instead, it is suggesting a causal relationship between polling data and the need for support from a specific group. However, the argument would need further evidence to support the causal link to avoid being a non sequitur or another type of fallacy."
"@keysdiver76 @Uberficker @NancyPelosi There is absolutely no way in hell all of tge polls were wrong.
Nobody except Trump banked on the electronic voting systems being hacked and the election stolen.
Anyone with reasoning skills can put two and two together.","**No**, the message does not contain a Circular Reasoning fallacy. The argument presented is based on the premise that only Trump anticipated the possibility of electronic voting systems being compromised, implying that other candidates did not consider this scenario. The reasoning provided is an attempt to explain a discrepancy in expectations rather than restating the premise as the conclusion. However, it's important to note that the argument could be challenged on other grounds, such as lack of evidence or oversimplification of complex issues."
@PeachyAmerican @Uberficker @NancyPelosi Anyone with reasoning skills would know the polls couldn't be hacked,"**No** - The message does not contain circular reasoning. It suggests that individuals with reasoning skills would understand that polls could not be hacked, implying that the ability to reason is linked to the understanding of the security of polls. However, it does not restate the premise as its conclusion; instead, it makes an assertion about the relationship between reasoning skills and the understanding of polls' security. The reasoning provided is not a loop but a conditional statement."
@keysdiver76 @Uberficker @NancyPelosi Kindly cite where you obtained that knowledge because it certainly hasn't been disseminated widely,"**No** - The message does not contain circular reasoning. The requester is asking for evidence or sources to support a claim made by others, which implies a desire for independent verification rather than restating the premise as the conclusion. The message challenges the others to provide proof, which is the opposite of circular reasoning."

However, without additional context or explanation, it's unclear what the reasoning behind the action is, but based on the given text alone, it does not exhibit circular reasoning."

It appears to be a rhetorical question or a challenge to someone's political stance, suggesting that the person has chosen to support someone they consider a bigot. The argument does not restate its premise as its conclusion; instead, it implies a contradiction between the person's actions and their values. However, without additional context or a clear argumentative structure, it's difficult to fully assess the reasoning presented."
"@Uberficker @PeachyAmerican @NancyPelosi You never answered me, where did I say I was a trump supporter?","**No** - The message does not contain circular reasoning. It is questioning the absence of a response regarding the speaker's political support, specifically for Trump. The argument or claim being made is not restated as its own proof; instead, it's seeking information or clarification."
@keysdiver76 @PeachyAmerican @NancyPelosi You're confused I think. I don't care.,"No, this message does not contain a Circular Reasoning fallacy. The statement provided does not restate the premise as the conclusion. Instead, it expresses a personal opinion about someone's confusion and indifference, without making a logical argument or attempting to prove a point through restated premises."
@Uberficker @PeachyAmerican @NancyPelosi That's the another reason for giving up liberalism,"**No** - The message provided does not contain circular reasoning. It presents an opinion or viewpoint that the speaker believes is another reason for abandoning liberalism. However, it does not restate the premise as the conclusion without additional support or evidence. To identify circular reasoning, there would need to be a statement where the conclusion is simply a rephrased version of the premise without any new information or logical progression."
@keysdiver76 @PeachyAmerican @NancyPelosi See these statements are broad generalizations that are absolutely foreign. They don't really assert anything.,"No, the message does not contain a Circular Reasoning fallacy. The statement criticizes broad generalizations but does not restate its premise as its conclusion. Instead, it expresses a viewpoint on the quality of the assertions made by the mentioned individuals, suggesting that they lack specificity or substance. There is no loop in reasoning where the conclusion is just a rephrased version of the premise."
"@Uberficker @PeachyAmerican @NancyPelosi Your original tweet stood for nothing except your own hate and anger, can't assert anything to such a statement except humor","**No** - The message does not contain circular reasoning. The argument presented is not a restatement of the premise but rather an opinion that the original tweet was driven by hate and anger. The claim made is about the emotional state behind the tweet, not a loop of reasoning that supports itself without independent evidence. However, it's worth noting that this statement could be challenged for lacking evidence or for being an ad hominem attack rather than a logical argument."
"@keysdiver76 @PeachyAmerican @NancyPelosi trump's a bigot, sexual predator and traitor. Those are worth hate and anger and I like that about me. I fuckin kick ass! 😀","**No**

The message provided does not contain circular reasoning. It is an expression of personal opinion and emotion towards a political figure, Trump, and does not attempt to argue a point by restating the premise as the conclusion. Instead, it uses adjectives and a personal declaration of action (kicking ass) to convey feelings, which is not a logical argument."
"@Uberficker @PeachyAmerican @NancyPelosi I'm very pleased you're happy being miserable, hateful and obsessed","**Yes** - The message contains circular reasoning because it implies that the individuals (@Uberficker, @PeachyAmerican, @NancyPelosi) are happy because they are miserable, hateful, and obsessed. This reasoning assumes that their negative traits are the reason for their happiness, which is a restatement of the premise without providing independent evidence or logical support. The conclusion (they are happy) is not supported by new information or reasoning; it simply restates the premise (they are miserable, hateful, and obsessed) in a different form."
@keysdiver76 @PeachyAmerican @NancyPelosi Angry isn't the same as miserable. It's fire... it means you stand for something! that's foreign to you maybe because you've never really believed in anything?,"**No** - The message does not contain circular reasoning. It is expressing an opinion that being angry can be a sign of standing for something, and it suggests that the lack of belief in anything might be why someone doesn't feel this way. It does not restate the premise as its conclusion; instead, it provides a reason (lack of belief) for the observed emotion (anger). However, the argument could be seen as somewhat weak or begging the question, as it assumes that standing for something is inherently positive without providing evidence, but it does not loop back to its own assertion."
"@Uberficker @keysdiver76 @NancyPelosi I have only seen your feedback since I told that guy so long, @Uberficker and am entertained.
Bless your heart for continuing to give him the time of day.","**No** - The message does not contain a Circular Reasoning fallacy. The statement is expressing a personal experience of receiving feedback and entertainment from others, without restating the premise as the conclusion. It does not loop back to its initial claim without independent support or evidence."
@PeachyAmerican @keysdiver76 @NancyPelosi It was entertaining for a while.😉,"No, this message does not contain a Circular Reasoning fallacy. The statement is an opinion about something being ""entertaining"" and includes a playful emoji. It does not attempt to prove a point by restating the premise as the conclusion, nor does it lack independent evidence to support a claim."
@Uberficker @keysdiver76 @NancyPelosi I tend to agree with that. But I usually cut it off to try to preserve my sanity. I would like to retain my IQ and not let these idiots zap away a few points. 😂,"**No** - The message does not contain circular reasoning. The individual is expressing their personal experience of disagreeing with certain viewpoints and their effort to maintain their mental well-being. They are not restating their premise as their conclusion; instead, they are providing a reason for their behavior (preserving sanity) without assuming the conclusion in the premise."
"@PeachyAmerican @keysdiver76 @NancyPelosi I agree. He's still trying to communicate w me but I it got boring watching him try to mansplain and take a moral high ground... I mean, trump, hahaha... You don't come back from that.","**No** - The message does not contain a circular reasoning fallacy. The user is expressing their opinion about someone's communication style and behavior, specifically relating to Trump. They are not using their conclusion to restate their initial premise without providing independent evidence. Instead, they are sharing a personal viewpoint based on their observations."
@Uberficker @PeachyAmerican @NancyPelosi And your point?,"**No** - The message does not contain a circular reasoning fallacy. It is simply a request for others to present their points or arguments. There is no restatement of a premise as the conclusion, nor is there a loop in reasoning."
Short-sighted decision to keep Franken in a Senate seat that would have been filled by a Democratic appointee anyway is going to cost Doug Jones the election.,**No** - The message does not contain circular reasoning. It presents a cause-and-effect scenario where a short-sighted decision (keeping Franken in a Senate seat) is linked to a potential negative outcome (costing Doug Jones the election). The reasoning provided is not simply restating the premise but is suggesting a possible consequence of the decision.
@mattyglesias You can be honest. Is there a contest? How many bad takes can a journalist make in a 24 hour period? Winning isn’t important. You can stop now.,"**No** - The message does not contain circular reasoning. It questions the honesty of a journalist and the frequency of bad takes in a 24-hour period, suggesting that winning is not the primary concern. It does not restate the premise as the conclusion; instead, it raises a question about journalistic integrity and performance, which could lead to a discussion or argument outside of a logical loop."
"@Cycle4 @mattyglesias nah it must be a 48 hour competition, that explains his 'suprise' that Trump is so orthodox right wing on economics tweet from yesterday","**No** - The message does not contain circular reasoning. It suggests an alternative explanation (a 48-hour competition) for why someone might tweet something unexpectedly conservative on economics. It does not restate the premise as the conclusion; instead, it offers a potential reason for the behavior observed, which could be independently verified or disproven."
"@ALPLPC @mattyglesias True, true.","**No** - The message provided does not contain a circular reasoning fallacy. It simply acknowledges agreement with the statements made by the other users, without attempting to prove a point through a loop of reasoning. There is no restatement of the premise as the conclusion."
"@Cycle4 @mattyglesias And I forget, was it him or Chait who had the totally driven by amnesia and deliberate misstating of facts take that Bill should have resigned over Lewinskey?","**No**

The message does not contain a circular reasoning fallacy. It appears to be a question or comment about a specific event or individual's actions, possibly related to a political or public figure. The statement does not restate its premise as its conclusion; instead, it seems to be seeking clarification or pointing out a potential issue with someone's stance or actions. There is no loop in reasoning where the conclusion is simply a restatement of the premise."
"@ALPLPC At this point, it was likely both. I’ve lost track of all the rewriters of history and common sense!","**Yes** - The message contains circular reasoning because it suggests that the truth about historical rewrites and common sense is ""likely both,"" without providing any independent evidence or argument to support this claim. The statement assumes what it's trying to prove, implying that the truth is uncertain because it's both, which is a tautology and does not advance the discussion or provide a logical foundation for the claim."
"@Cycle4 All of them trying to tie Clinton/Lewinsky to this moment forget that Lewinsky was the instigator, and that Bills problem was an inability to say No, not that he was hitting on women","**No**, the message does not contain a Circular Reasoning fallacy. The argument presented distinguishes between two separate issues: Lewinsky's role in the scandal and Bill's inability to say no. It does not restate its premise as its conclusion; instead, it provides a distinction between two causes, which is a form of argumentation that does not rely on circular logic."
"@Cycle4 Plus it was a real relationship, ongoing for months with gifts exchanged etc, she was only an intern for the first 8 days of their relationship so should be called WH Staffer &amp; so on &amp; so on","**No**, this message does not contain a Circular Reasoning fallacy. The argument provided is attempting to justify the nature of the relationship based on the duration and the exchange of gifts, which are external factors. It does not restate the premise as its conclusion; instead, it provides reasons to differentiate the relationship's status from an internship to a more substantial, ongoing relationship. However, it's worth noting that the argument could be strengthened with more concrete evidence or reasons to support the claim."
@Cycle4 Its criminal how so many on the supposed left have swallowed and regurgitate discredited GOP Talking Points &amp; language of that time,"**No**

The message does not contain circular reasoning. The statement criticizes individuals on the supposed left for regurgitating discredited talking points and language from a previous time, presumably associated with the GOP. It does not restate the premise as the conclusion; instead, it presents an argument about political behavior and historical context. The reasoning provided is an assertion about political actions rather than a logical loop that fails to provide independent support for its claim."
"@ALPLPC I agree. I’m old enough to have been there, and watching the rewrite has been a nightmare. I know Joe Conason tried valiantly to educate those saying stupid stuff, but I think they stuck their fingers in their ears.","**No** - The message does not contain a circular reasoning fallacy. The speaker is expressing their personal experience and opinion about the situation, mentioning their age and the efforts of Joe Conason. They are not restating the premise as the conclusion; instead, they are providing a reason (their age and experience) for their agreement with the statement."
"@Cycle4 The Hunting of the President was one of the most important books in forming my political (not policy) views.  The media has a lot to answer for, their failures during Whitewater directly gave us W and laid the groundwork for Trump","**No**, the message does not contain a Circular Reasoning fallacy. The statement explains that the book ""The Hunting of the President"" significantly influenced the person's political views and criticizes the media for their role in the events leading up to the election of Trump. It does not restate the premise as the conclusion; instead, it provides a reason (influence of the book) for a belief (political views) and a causal link (media failures leading to Trump's election)."
"@Cycle4 And the GOP still has never paid a price, in fact they have been rewarded for their dishonest &amp; destructive politics, its why I supported HRC in 08 with all his feelgood 'no blue or red States' stuff","**No**, the message does not contain a Circular Reasoning fallacy. The argument presented is a critique of the GOP's perceived political behavior and the speaker's support for HRC in 2008 based on that behavior. The reasoning provided is not simply restating the premise but rather giving a cause-and-effect relationship between the GOP's actions and the speaker's choice of candidate. The speaker is not using their conclusion to prove their initial premise without independent evidence; instead, they are providing a rationale for their political choice."
"@ALPLPC I am ready for them to pay a price. I never thought 20 years later they would have widened their destructive path, and yet, here we are. It’s time for the pendulum to swing, and for Dems to swing back.","**No** - The message does not contain circular reasoning. The speaker is expressing a viewpoint that it's time for a change in policy or direction, presumably in response to perceived ongoing issues. They are not restating their premise as their conclusion; instead, they are advocating for a shift in action, which implies a belief in a cause-and-effect relationship or a need for a different approach. The reasoning provided is not a loop but a call to action based on the speaker's interpretation of events."
"@Cycle4 It needs to happen at the ballot box, they need to be electorally rejected on a massive scale repeatedly until they change, but a both-siderist balance matters more than truth media make that unlikely","**No** - The message does not contain circular reasoning. It suggests a course of action (repeated electoral rejection) to achieve a change in behavior (electorally rejecting certain entities) and acknowledges a challenge (the importance of both-siderist balance in media). The reasoning provided is not simply restating the premise but is offering a strategy to address a perceived issue. However, it could be critiqued for potential oversimplification or lack of detail in how the strategy would be implemented."
"@Cycle4 Obviously I say all this in full appreciation of the fact I'm not telling u anything u don't already know, just wish more ppl knew it","**Yes** - The message contains circular reasoning because the speaker is asserting that they are not telling anything new, implying that their statement is redundant or obvious. However, they do not provide any new information or independent evidence to support their claim. The reasoning is circular because it assumes what it's trying to prove (that their message is not informative) without providing any external justification."
"@ALPLPC Oh, I know! It’s good to get it out- maybe someone who doesn’t know will see it and it can spark something.","**No** - The message does not contain circular reasoning. The speaker is suggesting that sharing information could lead to new perspectives or discussions, which is a form of argument based on the potential for dialogue and exchange of ideas. There is no restatement of the premise as the conclusion; instead, it is an appeal to the value of open communication."
@Cycle4 I would like that to be the case but twitter is so siloed now that you're always preaching to the choir. 1 good thing with this time is I now follow lots of never-Trump conservatives and their non-Trump policy tweets get me to confront different views,"**No**

The message does not contain a circular reasoning fallacy. The speaker is not concluding that following non-Trump conservative tweets is good because it exposes them to different views. Instead, they are presenting a reason (following diverse viewpoints) for why they find the action beneficial. The argument is not restating the premise but rather providing a rationale for their behavior."
"@ALPLPC Same. I agree with Bill Kristol frequently now, and it makes me think. Which is a good thing, but also confusing. 😂😂","**No** - The message does not contain a Circular Reasoning fallacy. The individual is expressing agreement with Bill Kristol's viewpoints and acknowledging that it leads to some confusion. There is no restatement of the premise as the conclusion; instead, it reflects a personal thought process and reaction to the information received."
"@Cycle4 Yeah, I've managed to avoid agreeing with Kristol, Mostly anyway... but Frum and scarily the old neo-cons sometimes (more often than I like tbh) say non-Trump related things I agree with which is really off-putting","**No**, the message does not contain a Circular Reasoning fallacy. The statement expresses the speaker's personal experience of disagreeing with Kristol and finding agreement with Frum and neo-cons on non-Trump related issues. There is no restatement of the premise as the conclusion; instead, it provides a reason for the speaker's feelings without looping back to the initial claim."
"@Cycle4 mind you I have never been a 'blame the west' lefty anyway, I've always thought that despite all its faults… https://t.co/zST5OjWKAY","**No** - The message does not contain circular reasoning. The individual is expressing a personal stance on not being a 'blame the west' lefty and acknowledges that they see faults in the West. There is no restatement of the premise as the conclusion; instead, it presents a viewpoint and a qualification of that viewpoint."
