This is sad. I have many friends and family with whom I disagree politically. Refusing to engage outside of your bubble is neither healthy nor unifying. https://t.co/TtJbghRLKx,"No, the message does not contain a Hasty Generalization fallacy. The statement is expressing a personal observation and opinion about the importance of engaging with diverse viewpoints for health and unity. It does not make a broad generalization based on insufficient evidence."
"@DLoesch When libs are pushing to overthrow a legally elected president, undermine our Republic and it's heritage, cram ideological perversities down our throats, and all with an air of self-righteous, moral superiority the time for engaging has passed. 1/2","Yes, the message contains a Hasty Generalization fallacy. It makes a sweeping statement about ""libs"" (liberals) based on the actions of some individuals or groups, implying that all liberals share the same intentions and behaviors. This generalization is made without sufficient evidence to support the claim that the entire group acts in such a manner."

The user quickly concludes that the legitimacy of a president is solely based on the GOP's association with Kris Kobach, without providing sufficient evidence or considering other factors that contribute to a president's legitimacy. This oversimplification leads to a hasty generalization."
@caldwellrobby3 @DLoesch Or maybe the exit polls were manipulated like many of the polls which predicted an overwhelming victory for HRC.,"Yes, the message contains a Hasty Generalization fallacy. The statement ""like many of the polls which predicted an overwhelming victory for HRC"" suggests that because some polls were manipulated, all polls (including the exit polls mentioned) must also be manipulated. This is a hasty generalization as it draws a broad conclusion based on limited evidence without sufficient justification."
"@caldwellrobby3 @DLoesch You must mean by ""purged"" that those ineligible to vote were purged. We now know that vote… https://t.co/HqBT2qETaO","No, the message provided does not explicitly contain a Hasty Generalization fallacy. The user is questioning the meaning of ""purged"" in the context of voter eligibility, which suggests a need for clarification rather than making a generalization based on insufficient evidence. However, without additional context or the full message, it's not possible to definitively rule out any underlying fallacies.

A Hasty Generalization fallacy occurs when someone makes a broad or general conclusion based on a small or insufficient sample size. In this case, the user is seeking clarification, not making a sweeping statement. If the full message contained a statement that made a generalization based on limited information, then it would be an example of a Hasty Generalization fallacy.

For a more accurate analysis, additional context or the complete message would be necessary."

A Hasty Generalization fallacy occurs when a conclusion is drawn from a sample that is too small or not representative. The message mentions ""Kris Kobach and 32 other GOP-controlled states would purge legitimate votes,"" but it does not make a generalized claim without sufficient evidence or a broad conclusion based on limited information. However, without further context or the full content of the message, it's challenging to definitively rule out any implied fallacies."

The user is making a broad assumption that all voters in question are Democrats based on limited or unspecified evidence of fraud. This generalization is hasty because it does not consider all possible variables or evidence and jumps to a conclusion without sufficient support."
@RobertL78 @DLoesch There is only a handful of cases of fraud in the last ten years . It’s not nearly as bad as gop… https://t.co/gwDKVeH3P7,"Yes

The message contains a Hasty Generalization fallacy. The speaker is making a broad generalization about the prevalence of fraud based on a limited number of cases (a ""handful"") over a ten-year period. This does not provide sufficient evidence to conclude that the situation is not ""as bad as gop"" (presumably referring to a political group or ideology). The speaker is generalizing the entire situation of fraud based on a small sample size, which is a classic example of a hasty generalization."

The message is expressing a concern about a specific law related to preregistration for minors turning 18 at voting time. It does not make a broad generalization based on insufficient evidence. However, it could be seen as a criticism or an opinion on a particular policy, which would need further context to determine if it's based on a fallacy."

The message seems to be comparing the implementation of a National Voter ID requirement to the requirement for welfare recipients, suggesting that both are not disenfranchising. However, it does not make a generalized claim without sufficient evidence. To identify a Hasty Generalization, there would need to be a sweeping statement made about a group based on insufficient or unrepresentative examples."

The individual is making a sweeping assumption about the political views of all Latinos of Mexican descent based on their personal belief that they do not support Democrats' stance on voter ID laws. This generalization is hasty because it does not consider the diversity of opinions within any demographic group."
And let’s say she’s the nominee. Elizabeth Warren will spend the first 4 minutes of every 7 minute TV interview answering the same question: “well ... WERE you dishonest about your heritage?” Rinse... repeat. https://t.co/9tvfO7M7PV,"Yes, the message suggests a Hasty Generalization fallacy. It quickly concludes that Elizabeth Warren will spend the first 4 minutes of every 7-minute TV interview answering the same question about her heritage, based on a limited observation or assumption. Without evidence that this pattern holds true for all interviews or a representative sample of them, the conclusion is a hasty generalization."

The speaker is expressing a personal opinion that they don't believe all or most conservatives care about a specific issue (her ancestry). A Hasty Generalization fallacy would involve making a broad claim based on insufficient evidence, which is not the case here. The speaker is not making a sweeping statement about all conservatives but is instead sharing a personal viewpoint."

The author quickly concludes that the individual in question is not competent or effective in political matters based on a limited set of actions (gutting the CFPB and net neutrality, passing a tax bill, and confirming judges) without considering the full context or the complexity of political decision-making.

The statement is more of a call to action, suggesting that people's responses to issues are determined by their imagination and will to act. It does not make a broad generalization based on insufficient evidence. However, it could be critiqued for assuming that people's actions are solely based on personal imagination and will, without considering other factors that might influence behavior."

The message contains a Hasty Generalization fallacy. The speaker quickly concludes that the entire Republic is in the hands of the few with great wealth and that the rest of the population is reduced to mere surfs in a fiefdom of corruption. This generalization is made without sufficient evidence to support such a sweeping claim about the state of the Republic and the distribution of wealth and power. It assumes that the situation is uniformly negative and widespread without considering variations, exceptions, or providing concrete data."

The statement is expressing a concern about the perceived decline in the influence of unions and the potential power of collective actions like walkouts and general strikes.

The message quickly jumps to the conclusion that Nancy Pelosi should be calling for and endorsing the impeachment of Trump solely based on accusations and the number of alleged victims. It does not consider the complexities of the legal process, the evidence required for impeachment, or the potential consequences of such an action. It assumes that because Trump is accused of wrongdoing, he must be impeached without a thorough examination of the facts."

This generalization is made without sufficient evidence and overlooks the complexity of political affiliations."
"@Uberficker @NancyPelosi And never forget, Trump won blue states, so your comment is really irrelevant","Yes, the message contains a Hasty Generalization fallacy. It makes a sweeping conclusion that Trump won blue states based on a single instance (presumably the 2016 election), and then dismisses any comment related to that event as irrelevant. This overlooks the complexity of election outcomes and the multitude of factors that can influence them. It also implies that all comments about Trump winning blue states are irrelevant, which is an overgeneralization."

The statement ""There is absolutely no way in hell all of the polls were wrong"" is a sweeping generalization that doesn't consider the possibility of polls being inaccurate due to various reasons such as sampling errors, polling methodology, or changes in public opinion close to election day. The message then quickly jumps to a specific claim about Trump and electronic voting systems without providing evidence, which further exemplifies a hasty generalization by assuming a single cause for a complex issue."
@PeachyAmerican @Uberficker @NancyPelosi Anyone with reasoning skills would know the polls couldn't be hacked,"Yes, the message contains a Hasty Generalization fallacy. The statement assumes that all individuals with reasoning skills would automatically know that polls cannot be hacked.

@keysdiver76 @PeachyAmerican @NancyPelosi See these statements are broad generalizations that are absolutely foreign. They don't really assert anything.,"Yes

The message indicates a recognition of hasty generalizations, which is a type of logical fallacy. A hasty generalization occurs when a conclusion is drawn from a sample that is too small or not representative. The user is pointing out that the statements in question are ""broad generalizations that are absolutely foreign"" and ""don't really assert anything,"" which implies that they are making sweeping conclusions without sufficient evidence. This is characteristic of a hasty generalization fallacy."
"@Uberficker @PeachyAmerican @NancyPelosi Your original tweet stood for nothing except your own hate and anger, can't assert anything to such a statement except humor","Yes, the message contains a Hasty Generalization fallacy. The sender quickly concludes that the original tweet from the mentioned users represents ""nothing but their own hate and anger"" without providing sufficient evidence to support such a sweeping claim. This generalization is made hastily based on a limited observation, which is characteristic of this fallacy."
"@keysdiver76 @PeachyAmerican @NancyPelosi trump's a bigot, sexual predator and traitor. Those are worth hate and anger and I like that about me. I fuckin kick ass! 😀","Yes. The message contains a Hasty Generalization fallacy. The individual is making sweeping negative generalizations about former President Trump, labeling him as a ""bigot, sexual predator, and traitor"" without providing evidence or considering the complexity of the situation. This generalization is used to justify personal feelings of anger and a sense of superiority, which is not a logically sound argument."
"@Uberficker @PeachyAmerican @NancyPelosi I'm very pleased you're happy being miserable, hateful and obsessed","Yes. The message contains a Hasty Generalization fallacy. It makes a sweeping assumption about the happiness and character of individuals (@Uberficker, @PeachyAmerican, @NancyPelosi) based on limited or no evidence. It generalizes their emotional state and behavior without considering individual differences or context."
@keysdiver76 @PeachyAmerican @NancyPelosi Angry isn't the same as miserable. It's fire... it means you stand for something! that's foreign to you maybe because you've never really believed in anything?,"Yes, the message contains a Hasty Generalization fallacy. The speaker quickly concludes that someone (possibly @PeachyAmerican or @NancyPelosi) who is angry stands for something and that they might not believe in anything because they have never really believed in anything. This generalization is made without sufficient evidence to support the claim that anger equates to standing for something or a lack of belief."
"@Uberficker @keysdiver76 @NancyPelosi I have only seen your feedback since I told that guy so long, @Uberficker and am entertained.
Bless your heart for continuing to give him the time of day.","No, the message does not contain a Hasty Generalization fallacy. A Hasty Generalization fallacy occurs when someone makes a broad generalization based on a small or unrepresentative sample. In this message, the speaker is sharing their personal experience and opinion about someone's feedback, but they are not making a sweeping statement about a larger group or category based on limited information."
@PeachyAmerican @keysdiver76 @NancyPelosi It was entertaining for a while.😉,"No, the message does not contain a Hasty Generalization fallacy. It appears to be a light-hearted comment or joke directed at specific individuals, without making a broad or generalized claim based on insufficient evidence."
@Uberficker @keysdiver76 @NancyPelosi I tend to agree with that. But I usually cut it off to try to preserve my sanity. I would like to retain my IQ and not let these idiots zap away a few points. 😂,"No, the message does not contain a Hasty Generalization fallacy. The user is expressing a personal opinion about cutting off conversations to maintain their mental well-being and is not making a broad generalization based on insufficient evidence. They are also not making a sweeping statement about a group's characteristics without proper support."
"@PeachyAmerican @keysdiver76 @NancyPelosi I agree. He's still trying to communicate w me but I it got boring watching him try to mansplain and take a moral high ground... I mean, trump, hahaha... You don't come back from that.","Yes, the message contains a Hasty Generalization fallacy. The commenter quickly concludes that ""Trump"" cannot come back from a certain situation based on a limited observation of one individual's behavior. This generalization does not consider other instances or evidence and makes a sweeping statement without sufficient support."
@Uberficker @PeachyAmerican @NancyPelosi And your point?,"No, the provided message does not contain a Hasty Generalization fallacy. It appears to be a part of a conversation or a thread where someone is asking for a point or argument from the mentioned users. There is no generalization being made from insufficient evidence or from a small sample size."
Short-sighted decision to keep Franken in a Senate seat that would have been filled by a Democratic appointee anyway is going to cost Doug Jones the election.,"No, the message does not contain a Hasty Generalization fallacy. It is a statement that suggests a specific action (keeping Franken in a Senate seat) could have negative consequences (costing Doug Jones the election). However, it does not make a broad generalization based on insufficient evidence. It implies a cause-and-effect relationship without overgeneralizing from a small sample size. To identify a Hasty Generalization, there would need to be a sweeping statement made about a whole group based on limited information."
@mattyglesias You can be honest. Is there a contest? How many bad takes can a journalist make in a 24 hour period? Winning isn’t important. You can stop now.,"No, the message does not contain a Hasty Generalization fallacy. A Hasty Generalization fallacy occurs when a conclusion is drawn from a sample that is too small or not representative. This message seems to be a question or a comment about journalistic integrity and the frequency of bad takes, without making a broad generalization about all journalists or a specific group based on insufficient evidence."
"@Cycle4 @mattyglesias nah it must be a 48 hour competition, that explains his 'suprise' that Trump is so orthodox right wing on economics tweet from yesterday","Yes, the message contains a Hasty Generalization fallacy. The user quickly concludes that Trump's economic views are orthodox right-wing based on a single tweet, without considering the complexity of economic views or the context of the tweet. They are generalizing Trump's entire economic stance from a potentially limited or singular piece of evidence."
"@ALPLPC @mattyglesias True, true.","No, the provided message does not contain a Hasty Generalization fallacy. It simply consists of two affirmative responses, ""@ALPLPC"" and ""@mattyglesias,"" without presenting any argument or generalization from which a fallacy could arise."
"@Cycle4 @mattyglesias And I forget, was it him or Chait who had the totally driven by amnesia and deliberate misstating of facts take that Bill should have resigned over Lewinskey?","Yes, the message contains a Hasty Generalization fallacy. The statement quickly jumps to a conclusion about Bill's actions based on a potentially limited or biased set of information (the ""totally driven by amnesia and deliberate misstating of facts"") without providing sufficient evidence to support such a broad claim. It assumes that Bill should have resigned solely because of the actions of Chait and Lewinskey, which is a generalization made without considering all relevant factors or possible counterarguments."
"@ALPLPC At this point, it was likely both. I’ve lost track of all the rewriters of history and common sense!","Yes, the message contains a Hasty Generalization fallacy. The speaker quickly concludes that ""it was likely both"" without providing sufficient evidence or considering the complexity of historical rewrites and the nuances of common sense. This leap to a general conclusion is characteristic of a hasty generalization, where a broad statement is made based on limited or insufficient evidence."
"@Cycle4 All of them trying to tie Clinton/Lewinsky to this moment forget that Lewinsky was the instigator, and that Bills problem was an inability to say No, not that he was hitting on women","No, the message does not contain a Hasty Generalization fallacy. The message is arguing that the focus on Clinton/Lewinsky is misplaced and instead points out that the real issue was Bills' inability to say no. A Hasty Generalization fallacy would involve making a broad conclusion based on insufficient evidence, which is not the case here. The message is providing a specific argument rather than generalizing from a small sample."
"@Cycle4 Plus it was a real relationship, ongoing for months with gifts exchanged etc, she was only an intern for the first 8 days of their relationship so should be called WH Staffer &amp; so on &amp; so on","Yes, the message contains a Hasty Generalization fallacy. The argument hastily generalizes that because the woman was an intern for the first 8 days of the relationship, she should be considered a WH (Working Holiday) Staffer for the entire duration of the relationship. This overlooks the possibility of her role or status changing after those initial days and assumes a constant condition without sufficient evidence."
@Cycle4 Its criminal how so many on the supposed left have swallowed and regurgitate discredited GOP Talking Points &amp; language of that time,"Yes, the message contains a Hasty Generalization fallacy. The statement ""so many on the supposed left have swallowed and regurgitate discredited GOP Talking Points &amp; language of that time"" makes a sweeping assumption about a large group (the supposed left) without providing sufficient evidence or acknowledging potential exceptions. It hastily generalizes that all members of the supposed left accept and repeat discredited GOP talking points and language, which is not necessarily true for every individual within that group."
"@ALPLPC I agree. I’m old enough to have been there, and watching the rewrite has been a nightmare. I know Joe Conason tried valiantly to educate those saying stupid stuff, but I think they stuck their fingers in their ears.","Yes, the message contains a Hasty Generalization fallacy. The speaker quickly concludes that ""those saying stupid stuff"" are not listening to Joe Conason's efforts to educate them, without providing evidence that all or most of the people in question are indeed ignoring the educational attempts. This generalization is made based on a limited observation and does not consider other possible reasons why people might not be engaging with the information presented."
"@Cycle4 The Hunting of the President was one of the most important books in forming my political (not policy) views.  The media has a lot to answer for, their failures during Whitewater directly gave us W and laid the groundwork for Trump","Yes, the message contains a Hasty Generalization fallacy. The individual is generalizing that the media's failures during the Whitewater investigation directly led to the election of Trump and the formation of their political views. This is a hasty generalization because it assumes a direct causation from a single event (media failures in Whitewater) to a broad outcome (the election of Trump and shaping political views), without considering other factors or evidence that could have contributed to these outcomes."
"@Cycle4 And the GOP still has never paid a price, in fact they have been rewarded for their dishonest &amp; destructive politics, its why I supported HRC in 08 with all his feelgood 'no blue or red States' stuff","Yes, the message contains a Hasty Generalization fallacy. The user quickly concludes that the GOP (Grand Old Party, another name for the Republican Party) has been rewarded for their dishonest and destructive politics based on their support for HRC (Hillary Clinton) in 2008. This is a hasty generalization because it draws a broad conclusion from a single event or limited evidence, without considering other factors or a wider range of experiences."
"@ALPLPC I am ready for them to pay a price. I never thought 20 years later they would have widened their destructive path, and yet, here we are. It’s time for the pendulum to swing, and for Dems to swing back.","No, the message does not contain a Hasty Generalization fallacy. The statement expresses a viewpoint on political change and the perceived need for action, but it does not make a generalized claim based on insufficient evidence. A Hasty Generalization would involve drawing a conclusion from a small or unrepresentative sample, which is not evident in this message."
"@Cycle4 It needs to happen at the ballot box, they need to be electorally rejected on a massive scale repeatedly until they change, but a both-siderist balance matters more than truth media make that unlikely","Yes, the message contains a Hasty Generalization fallacy. The statement suggests that both sides of an issue must be balanced in the media, implying that this balance is a prerequisite for change. It hastily generalizes that achieving balance in media coverage is the only way to effect change, without considering other factors that could influence the situation. It also assumes that the media's portrayal of issues is the primary driver of change, which may not always be the case."
"@Cycle4 Obviously I say all this in full appreciation of the fact I'm not telling u anything u don't already know, just wish more ppl knew it","No, the message does not contain a Hasty Generalization fallacy. A Hasty Generalization is a fallacy in which a conclusion is not logically justified by sufficient or unbiased evidence. The message provided is a statement of appreciation and does not make a generalization or draw a conclusion from insufficient evidence."
"@ALPLPC Oh, I know! It’s good to get it out- maybe someone who doesn’t know will see it and it can spark something.","No, the message does not contain a Hasty Generalization fallacy. The statement seems to be an encouragement for sharing ideas, without making a broad or generalized claim based on insufficient evidence."
@Cycle4 I would like that to be the case but twitter is so siloed now that you're always preaching to the choir. 1 good thing with this time is I now follow lots of never-Trump conservatives and their non-Trump policy tweets get me to confront different views,"No, the message does not contain a Hasty Generalization fallacy. The user is expressing a personal experience of following more diverse viewpoints on Twitter and acknowledging the platform's tendency to create echo chambers. There is no sweeping generalization made about a group or situation without sufficient evidence."
"@ALPLPC Same. I agree with Bill Kristol frequently now, and it makes me think. Which is a good thing, but also confusing. 😂😂","No, the message provided does not contain a Hasty Generalization fallacy. The user is expressing a personal change in agreement with Bill Kristol's views and acknowledging that this shift is both positive and confusing. There is no sweeping generalization made from a small sample size without sufficient evidence."
"@Cycle4 Yeah, I've managed to avoid agreeing with Kristol, Mostly anyway... but Frum and scarily the old neo-cons sometimes (more often than I like tbh) say non-Trump related things I agree with which is really off-putting","No, the message does not contain a Hasty Generalization fallacy. The user is expressing their personal experience and feelings about certain individuals and their statements. They are not making a broad generalization about a group based on insufficient evidence. However, they do express a personal bias, which is not a logical fallacy."
"@Cycle4 mind you I have never been a 'blame the west' lefty anyway, I've always thought that despite all its faults… https://t.co/zST5OjWKAY","No, the message does not contain a Hasty Generalization fallacy. The user is expressing a personal opinion about not being a 'blame the west' lefty and acknowledges that there are faults in the west. There is no sweeping generalization made about all westerners or a group based on insufficient evidence."
