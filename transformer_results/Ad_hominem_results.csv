Tweet,Fallacy Evaluation
This is sad. I have many friends and family with whom I disagree politically. Refusing to engage outside of your bubble is neither healthy nor unifying. https://t.co/TtJbghRLKx,"No, the tweet does not contain an Ad Hominem fallacy. The message criticizes the act of refusing to engage in political discussions with those who have differing views, but it does not attack the person making an argument based on their character or personal traits. It is a comment on the importance of open dialogue and understanding in a democratic society."
"@DLoesch When libs are pushing to overthrow a legally elected president, undermine our Republic and it's heritage, cram ideological perversities down our throats, and all with an air of self-righteous, moral superiority the time for engaging has passed. 1/2","No, the tweet does not contain an Ad Hominem fallacy. The tweet criticizes a group (liberals) for their actions and beliefs, but it does not attack the individuals personally or their character. The criticism is directed at the group's perceived actions and ideology, which is a different matter. An Ad Hominem fallacy would involve attacking the person's character or attributes instead of addressing the argument or issue at hand."

The tweet seems to be discussing the legitimacy of a president and mentions a political figure (Kris Kobach), but it does not directly attack the person's character or personal traits as a means to discredit their argument. However, without the full context of the tweet, it's challenging to definitively rule out any implied Ad Hominem attacks. The link provided also does not give enough information to determine the presence of a fallacy."
@caldwellrobby3 @DLoesch Or maybe the exit polls were manipulated like many of the polls which predicted an overwhelming victory for HRC.,"No, the tweet does not contain an Ad Hominem fallacy. The comment is questioning the validity of exit polls and making a comparison to other polls, which is a critique of the data or methodology rather than an attack on the person presenting the argument. An Ad Hominem fallacy would involve attacking the character or motive of the person making the argument, which is not present in this message."
"@caldwellrobby3 @DLoesch You must mean by ""purged"" that those ineligible to vote were purged. We now know that vote… https://t.co/HqBT2qETaO","No, the tweet provided does not contain an Ad Hominem fallacy. The tweet is engaging in a discussion about the meaning of the word ""purged"" in the context of voting eligibility. It does not attack the person making the argument (either @caldwellrobby3 or @DLoesch) but rather seeks clarification on a point of contention. An Ad Hominem fallacy would involve a personal attack or dismissal of the argument based on the person's characteristics rather than the argument's merits."

Kris kobach and 32 other gop controlled states would purge legit v… https://t.co/NZVIG4IsKE","No, the provided message does not contain an Ad Hominem fallacy. The tweet is discussing a political issue (purging voter rolls) and mentions Kris Kobach and other GOP-controlled states. There is no direct attack on an individual's character or personal traits as a means to discredit their argument. The focus is on the topic at hand."
@caldwellrobby3 @DLoesch Are you saying those voters were Dems exclusively? There is a lot of evidence of fraud lik… https://t.co/ZoChNHNMso,"No, the provided message does not contain an Ad Hominem fallacy. The tweet is questioning a claim about voters and fraud, and it does not attack the character or personal traits of the individuals (@caldwellrobby3 and @DLoesch). It appears to be a part of a discussion or debate on a specific topic. However, without the full context of the conversation, it's difficult to definitively rule out any potential fallacies."

It’s not nearly as bad as gop… https://t.co/gwDKVeH3P7,"No, the provided message does not contain an Ad Hominem fallacy. The tweet is discussing the frequency of fraud cases and comparing it to an unspecified group (presumably the GOP, based on the context). There is no direct attack on an individual's character or personal traits as a means to discredit their argument. The focus is on the topic of fraud cases. However, without additional context or a clear indication of an attack on a person, it's not possible to definitively say there is no underlying implication or fallacy. The tweet could potentially be seen as a hasty generalization if the comparison to the GOP is meant to imply that the GOP is responsible for more fraud without proper evidence. But as it stands, it does not contain an Ad Hominem fallacy."

Progress Actio… https://t.co/bOIUfjZb3c","No, the provided tweet does not contain an Ad Hominem fallacy. The tweet appears to be a call to read various sources from different political perspectives (conservative and liberal) and does not attack any individual's character or personal traits as part of the argument. It is simply suggesting a balanced approach to understanding different viewpoints."

The tweet criticizes a specific law related to preregistration for minors turning 18 at voting time, and it does not attack the character or personal traits of the individuals mentioned (@caldwellrobby3 and @DLoesch). The argument is focused on the policy itself."
@caldwellrobby3 @DLoesch 4. Nat'l Voter ID will not disenfranchise anyone any more than requiring welfare recipient… https://t.co/Fo8WPNI7JZ,"No, the provided message does not contain an Ad Hominem fallacy. The tweet is discussing the National Voter ID law and comparing it to welfare requirements. There is no personal attack on an individual making an argument; rather, it seems to be a comparison of two different policies. However, without additional context or the full argument, it's difficult to determine if the comparison is logically sound or if it contains any other fallacies. The message as provided does not exhibit the characteristics of an Ad Hominem attack."
@caldwellrobby3 @DLoesch I'm a Latino of Mexican decent and don't have parience for Dems handwrining over voter ID.… https://t.co/vP4UIIRldj,"Yes, the tweet contains an Ad Hominem fallacy. The user is attacking the credibility or character of individuals associated with the Democratic party (implied by ""Dems"") based on their ethnicity and personal background, rather than addressing the argument or issue regarding voter ID laws. This personal attack is irrelevant to the discussion of the policy itself."
And let’s say she’s the nominee. Elizabeth Warren will spend the first 4 minutes of every 7 minute TV interview answering the same question: “well ... WERE you dishonest about your heritage?” Rinse... repeat. https://t.co/9tvfO7M7PV,"No, the tweet does not contain an Ad Hominem fallacy. The tweet criticizes Elizabeth Warren's approach to TV interviews, but it does not attack her character or personal attributes as a means to discredit her argument. Instead, it focuses on a perceived pattern in her responses during interviews."
"@JoyAnnReid 

Novel idea - She can simply admit that she lied about her heritage for financial and professional gain.

Problem solved.

EOM","No, the tweet provided does not contain an Ad Hominem fallacy. The statement criticizes Joy Ann Reid's actions (lying about her heritage for financial and professional gain) rather than attacking her personal characteristics or traits. The criticism is directed at the action itself, which is a legitimate form of argumentation. An Ad Hominem fallacy would involve attacking Reid's character or personal attributes instead of focusing on the issue at hand."
@the_kaboom @JoyAnnReid How do you or anyone know she lied? Did something concrete come out?,"No, the tweet does not contain an Ad Hominem fallacy. The person is questioning the evidence behind a claim about someone lying, rather than attacking the person making the claim. They are asking for concrete proof, which is a valid line of questioning in a logical argument."
"@andrea_4_real @JoyAnnReid 

The one primary reason would be that she has never refuted the plain accusation that she did.

"@the_kaboom @JoyAnnReid But, there's no concrete proof she's not, right?","No, the tweet does not contain an Ad Hominem fallacy. The statement is questioning the lack of concrete proof regarding a person's position or claim, which is a legitimate line of inquiry in a debate or discussion. It does not attack the person's character or attributes."

I saw a post on Twitter today fr organization that researched her heritage back 6 generations, all noted at time as full white, no NA. Not sure I can find that link.","No, the tweet does not contain an Ad Hominem fallacy. The tweet is questioning the credibility of the research on someone's heritage by expressing doubt about finding the source of the information. It does not attack the person making an argument (Andrea, @the_kaboom, or JoyAnnReid) but rather questions the evidence provided. An Ad Hominem fallacy would involve attacking the character or motive of the person rather than addressing the argument they are making."
@CreateCivility @the_kaboom @JoyAnnReid Why are conservatives so obsessed with her heritage?,"Yes, the tweet contains an Ad Hominem fallacy. The tweeter is attacking Joy Ann Reid's heritage, which is irrelevant to the argument or discussion about her professional work or political views. Instead of addressing any specific argument or policy, the tweeter is attacking a personal characteristic, which is a classic example of an Ad Hominem fallacy."

The statement is addressing a viewpoint about conservatives and their concern for someone's ancestry. It does not attack the person making an argument but rather discusses a political stance. There is no personal attack involved."

The message is a statement about the importance of authenticity in politics and does not attack any individual's character or personal traits as a means to discredit their argument."

The tweet seems to be expressing a political opinion, suggesting that conservatives only care about certain issues when it benefits democrats. There is no direct attack on the character or personal attributes of an individual making an argument. Therefore, the answer is **No**.

However, it's worth noting that the tone of the message could be perceived as dismissive or condescending, which might imply a subtle form of ad hominem by implying that the other users' views are not valid or are only of interest to democrats. But without a clear attack on the person, it remains a statement of opinion rather than a fallacious argument."

The tweet is a question directed at individuals, asking for their support for Trump. It does not attack the individuals personally or their character as a means to discredit their argument or position. However, it's important to note that the context in which this question is asked could potentially lead to an Ad Hominem fallacy if it's used to imply that their support or lack thereof is a reflection of their character rather than their political beliefs.

The statement criticizes the reasons why some people might not act on behalf of the media or minorities, suggesting that the issue is not abstract and can affect anyone. It does not attack the person making an argument but rather addresses the argument's content."

The tweeter is attacking Nancy Pelosi's character and suggesting that her failure to call for impeachment is due to her being a ""bigot"" and accusing her of not standing up for the victims. This personal attack does not address the actual argument or reasons for or against impeachment. Instead, it targets Pelosi's character, which is irrelevant to the logical discussion of the impeachment process."

The tweeter is attacking Nancy Pelosi and her team's communication skills rather than addressing any specific argument or issue they may have presented.

The tweet appears to be a personal statement from the user expressing a change of opinion and a joke about their previous stance. There is no direct attack on Nancy Pelosi's character or personal attributes as part of the argument. However, it's worth noting that the tone and context could potentially be interpreted as dismissive or mocking, but without a clear argumentative context targeting Pelosi's personal traits, it's not an Ad Hominem fallacy."
@Uberficker @NancyPelosi You called it,"The provided message snippet is incomplete and does not contain enough information to determine whether it includes an Ad Hominem fallacy. To properly assess the presence of an Ad Hominem fallacy, the full context of the message is required. The message should ideally show a scenario where a person (in this case, presumably @Uberficker and @NancyPelosi) is being attacked personally rather than their argument or position.

For example, if the full message was: ""@Uberficker You called it, but your lack of experience in economics makes your argument invalid,"" it would contain an Ad Hominem fallacy because it dismisses @Uberficker's argument based on their personal characteristic (lack of experience) rather than addressing the argument itself.

The second part of the message, ""You're veering off course,"" could be interpreted as a critique of the argument's direction, but it does not directly attack Nancy Pelosi's character or personal attributes.

@keysdiver76 @PeachyAmerican @NancyPelosi I been angry about a lot of things for a long time... now it's just a tool that works a lil better. 😀,"No, the tweet does not contain an Ad Hominem fallacy. The user is expressing their personal feelings of anger and does not attack any individual's character or argument. There is no mention or implication of criticizing someone's argument by attacking the person instead."
@Uberficker @PeachyAmerican @NancyPelosi Why I gave up Liberalism,"The provided message does not contain an Ad Hominem fallacy. The tweet is a statement from a user expressing their personal decision to give up Liberalism. There is no direct attack on the character or attributes of any individual making an argument. Therefore, the answer is **No**.

However, it's important to note that while the tweet itself does not contain an Ad Hominem fallacy, the context in which it is used could potentially lead to such a fallacy if someone were to respond by attacking the individuals mentioned (Uberficker, PeachyAmerican, Nancy Pelosi) instead of addressing the reasons behind the user's decision to give up Liberalism. But based solely on the content of the tweet, there is no fallacy present."
@keysdiver76 @PeachyAmerican @NancyPelosi So you just decided to up and support a bigot?,"Yes, the tweet contains an Ad Hominem fallacy. The tweeter is attacking the character of the individuals (@keysdiver76, @PeachyAmerican, @NancyPelosi) by accusing them of supporting a bigot, rather than addressing any specific argument or stance they may have taken. This personal attack is a diversion from the actual discussion and is a classic example of an Ad Hominem fallacy."
"@Uberficker @PeachyAmerican @NancyPelosi You never answered me, where did I say I was a trump supporter?","Yes, the tweet contains an Ad Hominem fallacy. The person is attacking @PeachyAmerican and @NancyPelosi by implying they are not paying attention or not listening, rather than addressing any argument or statement that might have been made by these individuals. The focus is on the alleged behavior of the individuals rather than the content of their potential arguments."
@keysdiver76 @PeachyAmerican @NancyPelosi You're confused I think. I don't care.,"No, the given message does not contain an Ad Hominem fallacy. The tweet simply states that the person believes others are confused and dismisses the conversation without attacking the individuals' character or personal attributes. There is no direct or indirect attack on the people mentioned based on their personal characteristics or their argument."
@Uberficker @PeachyAmerican @NancyPelosi That's the another reason for giving up liberalism,"The provided message does not contain an Ad Hominem fallacy. The tweet criticizes the idea of giving up liberalism but does not attack any individual's character or personal attributes as part of the argument. Therefore, the answer is **No**.

However, it's worth noting that the tweet does not provide a clear argument or context, and it seems to be a general statement about political ideology rather than a structured argument. Without more context, it's difficult to fully assess the nature of the argument being made."
@keysdiver76 @PeachyAmerican @NancyPelosi See these statements are broad generalizations that are absolutely foreign. They don't really assert anything.,"No, the tweet does not contain an Ad Hominem fallacy. The comment criticizes the statements made by others for being broad generalizations and not asserting anything substantial. It does not attack the individuals personally but rather the content of their statements. An Ad Hominem fallacy would involve attacking the character or motive of the person making the argument rather than the argument itself."
"@Uberficker @PeachyAmerican @NancyPelosi Your original tweet stood for nothing except your own hate and anger, can't assert anything to such a statement except humor","Yes, the tweet contains an Ad Hominem fallacy. The person is attacking the character and emotions of the individuals (@Uberficker, @PeachyAmerican, @NancyPelosi) rather than addressing any specific argument or stance they may have presented. The attack on their ""hate and anger"" and the implication that they can't assert anything meaningful is a personal attack meant to discredit them instead of engaging with their ideas."
"@keysdiver76 @PeachyAmerican @NancyPelosi trump's a bigot, sexual predator and traitor. Those are worth hate and anger and I like that about me. I fuckin kick ass! 😀","Yes, the tweet contains an Ad Hominem fallacy. The user is attacking individuals (Trump, PeachyAmerican, Nancy Pelosi) by labeling them as a ""bigot,"" ""sexual predator,"" and ""traitor,"" instead of addressing any specific arguments or policies they may have proposed. Furthermore, the user's personal feelings of anger and self-justification (""I like that about me. I fuckin kick ass!"") do not contribute to a logical argument and serve to distract from the actual issues at hand."
"@Uberficker @PeachyAmerican @NancyPelosi I'm very pleased you're happy being miserable, hateful and obsessed","Yes, the tweet contains an Ad Hominem fallacy. The tweeter is attacking the character and personal attributes of the individuals (@Uberficker, @PeachyAmerican, @NancyPelosi) rather than addressing any argument or issue they may have presented. This type of attack is irrelevant to the validity of their arguments and is a common logical fallacy."
@keysdiver76 @PeachyAmerican @NancyPelosi Angry isn't the same as miserable. It's fire... it means you stand for something! that's foreign to you maybe because you've never really believed in anything?,"Yes, the tweet contains an Ad Hominem fallacy. The tweeter is attacking @PeachyAmerican's character and beliefs (implying they don't truly believe in anything) instead of addressing any specific argument or stance that @PeachyAmerican might have made. The use of ""maybe because you've never really believed in anything?"" is an attempt to discredit the opponent's position by questioning their sincerity, which is a hallmark of the Ad Hominem fallacy."
"@Uberficker @keysdiver76 @NancyPelosi I have only seen your feedback since I told that guy so long, @Uberficker and am entertained.
Bless your heart for continuing to give him the time of day.","No, the tweet does not contain an Ad Hominem fallacy. The commenter is not attacking the character or personal traits of the individuals (@Uberficker, @keysdiver76, @NancyPelosi) but rather expressing amusement at the situation and acknowledging the time given to someone else. There is no direct attack on the person's argument or position."
@PeachyAmerican @keysdiver76 @NancyPelosi It was entertaining for a while.😉,"No, the tweet does not contain an Ad Hominem fallacy. The message does not attack any individual's character or personal attributes as a means to discredit their argument. It simply expresses that something was entertaining and includes a wink emoticon, which does not relate to any logical fallacy."
@Uberficker @keysdiver76 @NancyPelosi I tend to agree with that. But I usually cut it off to try to preserve my sanity. I would like to retain my IQ and not let these idiots zap away a few points. 😂,"Yes, the tweet contains an Ad Hominem fallacy. The speaker is dismissing the arguments of others (implied by ""these idiots"") not by engaging with the actual content of the arguments but by attacking the character of the people making the arguments. The use of the term ""idiots"" is a personal attack meant to undermine the opponents' credibility rather than addressing their points logically."
"@PeachyAmerican @keysdiver76 @NancyPelosi I agree. He's still trying to communicate w me but I it got boring watching him try to mansplain and take a moral high ground... I mean, trump, hahaha... You don't come back from that.","Yes, the tweet contains an Ad Hominem fallacy. The commentator is attacking Trump's character (""trying to mansplain and take a moral high ground"") instead of addressing any specific argument or policy that Trump might have presented. The use of humor (""You don't come back from that"") further indicates a personal attack rather than a reasoned critique of Trump's ideas or actions."
@Uberficker @PeachyAmerican @NancyPelosi And your point?,"No, the given message does not contain an Ad Hominem fallacy. The message is simply asking for a response or point from the mentioned individuals. There is no attack on the person's character or personal traits as part of the argument."
Short-sighted decision to keep Franken in a Senate seat that would have been filled by a Democratic appointee anyway is going to cost Doug Jones the election.,"No, the tweet does not contain an Ad Hominem fallacy. The statement criticizes a political decision regarding the filling of a Senate seat and its potential impact on an election, without attacking the character or motives of the person making the argument. It focuses on the policy and its consequences rather than on the person."
@mattyglesias You can be honest. Is there a contest? How many bad takes can a journalist make in a 24 hour period? Winning isn’t important. You can stop now.,"No, the tweet does not contain an Ad Hominem fallacy. The commenter is questioning the journalist's honesty and criticizing their work, but they are not directly attacking the journalist's character in a way that diverts from the argument's substance. Instead, they are challenging the journalist's credibility and the quality of their work, which is a critique of the argument's content. However, it's worth noting that this could be seen as a form of personal attack or an attempt to undermine the journalist's argument indirectly. The key distinction here is that the commenter is still addressing the argument (the journalist's honesty and work quality), even if in a potentially confrontational manner."
"@Cycle4 @mattyglesias nah it must be a 48 hour competition, that explains his 'suprise' that Trump is so orthodox right wing on economics tweet from yesterday","No, the tweet does not contain an Ad Hominem fallacy. The commenter is not attacking the person (@mattyglesias) personally but is instead suggesting a possible explanation for the content of the tweet. They are engaging with the argument presented (the content of the tweet) rather than attacking the individual making the argument."
"@ALPLPC @mattyglesias True, true.","No, the given tweet does not contain an Ad Hominem fallacy. The tweet simply acknowledges another user's statement with ""True, true."" There is no attack on the person making the argument, nor is there an attempt to discredit the argument by attacking the person."
"@Cycle4 @mattyglesias And I forget, was it him or Chait who had the totally driven by amnesia and deliberate misstating of facts take that Bill should have resigned over Lewinskey?","Yes, the tweet contains an Ad Hominem fallacy. The tweeter is attacking the character or motives of individuals (implied to be Chait and Lewinskey) rather than addressing the actual argument or issue regarding Bill's resignation. The focus on ""driven by amnesia and deliberate misstating of facts"" is an attempt to discredit the individuals involved instead of engaging with the substance of the argument."
"@ALPLPC At this point, it was likely both. I’ve lost track of all the rewriters of history and common sense!","Yes, the tweet contains an element of an Ad Hominem fallacy. The speaker is attacking the character or credibility of the individuals (referred to as ""rewriters of history and common sense"") rather than addressing the actual arguments or evidence presented by those individuals. By focusing on the people rather than the substance of their claims, the speaker is attempting to discredit the argument through personal criticism, which is characteristic of an Ad Hominem fallacy."
"@Cycle4 All of them trying to tie Clinton/Lewinsky to this moment forget that Lewinsky was the instigator, and that Bills problem was an inability to say No, not that he was hitting on women","No, the tweet does not contain an Ad Hominem fallacy. The tweet is addressing the argument by pointing out specific points related to the Lewinsky scandal and the Bills' behavior. It does not attack the character or personal traits of the individuals involved but rather focuses on the issues at hand."
"@Cycle4 Plus it was a real relationship, ongoing for months with gifts exchanged etc, she was only an intern for the first 8 days of their relationship so should be called WH Staffer &amp; so on &amp; so on","No, the given message does not contain an Ad Hominem fallacy. The tweet is discussing the nature of a relationship and the roles of the individuals involved, without attacking the person's character or credibility. However, it does seem to be making a point about the distinction between an intern and a staffer, which could be a matter of debate or misunderstanding rather than a personal attack."
@Cycle4 Its criminal how so many on the supposed left have swallowed and regurgitate discredited GOP Talking Points &amp; language of that time,"No, the tweet does not contain an Ad Hominem fallacy. The user is criticizing the actions of people on the supposed left for regurgitating discredited talking points from the GOP (Grand Old Party, another name for the Republican Party). The criticism is directed at the behavior of the individuals (regurgitating discredited talking points) rather than attacking their character or personal attributes. An Ad Hominem fallacy would involve attacking the person's character or traits instead of addressing the argument they are making."
"@ALPLPC I agree. I’m old enough to have been there, and watching the rewrite has been a nightmare. I know Joe Conason tried valiantly to educate those saying stupid stuff, but I think they stuck their fingers in their ears.","No, the tweet does not contain an Ad Hominem fallacy. The user is expressing their personal experience and opinion about the situation, and while they mention Joe Conason's efforts, they do not directly attack him personally as part of the argument. Instead, they criticize the behavior of others as a response to Conason's attempts to educate, which is a critique of the group's actions rather than a personal attack on Conason himself."
"@Cycle4 The Hunting of the President was one of the most important books in forming my political (not policy) views.  The media has a lot to answer for, their failures during Whitewater directly gave us W and laid the groundwork for Trump","No, the tweet does not contain an Ad Hominem fallacy. The user is expressing their opinion on how a book influenced their political views and criticizing the media's role in political events. There is no direct attack on an individual's character or personal attributes as part of the argument. The criticism is directed at the media's actions and their consequences, which is a separate issue from the person making the argument."
"@Cycle4 And the GOP still has never paid a price, in fact they have been rewarded for their dishonest &amp; destructive politics, its why I supported HRC in 08 with all his feelgood 'no blue or red States' stuff","No, the tweet does not contain an Ad Hominem fallacy. The user is criticizing the GOP's political actions and decisions, and expressing their support for HRC based on their political stance. The argument is focused on the actions and policies of the political parties, not attacking the individuals personally. However, it's worth noting that the tone of the message could be perceived as somewhat biased or dismissive of the GOP's actions, but this does not constitute an Ad Hominem fallacy."
"@ALPLPC I am ready for them to pay a price. I never thought 20 years later they would have widened their destructive path, and yet, here we are. It’s time for the pendulum to swing, and for Dems to swing back.","No, the tweet does not contain an Ad Hominem fallacy. The user is expressing their opinion on a political matter and criticizing a perceived action or policy without attacking the character or personal attributes of any individual. They are not attacking someone's personal traits to undermine their argument."
"@Cycle4 It needs to happen at the ballot box, they need to be electorally rejected on a massive scale repeatedly until they change, but a both-siderist balance matters more than truth media make that unlikely","No, the tweet does not contain an Ad Hominem fallacy. The comment focuses on the idea of electoral processes and the influence of media on political change, without directly attacking an individual's character or personal attributes. The argument is about the mechanisms of political change and the role of media, not about personal characteristics of individuals involved."
"@Cycle4 Obviously I say all this in full appreciation of the fact I'm not telling u anything u don't already know, just wish more ppl knew it","No, the provided message does not contain an Ad Hominem fallacy. The tweet is from a user who is not directly attacking another person's character but is instead expressing a desire for more people to be aware of certain information. There is no direct attack on someone's personal attributes or credibility as part of the argument presented."
"@ALPLPC Oh, I know! It’s good to get it out- maybe someone who doesn’t know will see it and it can spark something.","No, the tweet does not contain an Ad Hominem fallacy. The message seems to be encouraging open discussion and does not attack an individual's character or personal traits as a means to discredit their argument. It lacks any personal attacks and focuses on the idea of sharing information."
@Cycle4 I would like that to be the case but twitter is so siloed now that you're always preaching to the choir. 1 good thing with this time is I now follow lots of never-Trump conservatives and their non-Trump policy tweets get me to confront different views,"No, the tweet does not contain an Ad Hominem fallacy. The user is expressing a personal experience with following different political viewpoints on Twitter and does not attack anyone's character or personal attributes as part of their argument. The comment focuses on the diversity of opinions and the user's engagement with them, rather than criticizing the individuals behind those opinions."
"@ALPLPC Same. I agree with Bill Kristol frequently now, and it makes me think. Which is a good thing, but also confusing. 😂😂","No, the tweet does not contain an Ad Hominem fallacy. The user is expressing their agreement with Bill Kristol and their personal feelings about it, without attacking Kristol's character or dismissing his arguments based on who he is."
"@Cycle4 Yeah, I've managed to avoid agreeing with Kristol, Mostly anyway... but Frum and scarily the old neo-cons sometimes (more often than I like tbh) say non-Trump related things I agree with which is really off-putting","No, the tweet does not contain an Ad Hominem fallacy. The user is expressing their personal feelings about agreeing with certain individuals and their dislike for non-Trump related statements from others. There is no direct attack on the character or personal attributes of the individuals mentioned (Kristol, Frum, or neo-cons) as a means to discredit their arguments. The user is critiquing the content of the statements rather than the person making them."
"@Cycle4 mind you I have never been a 'blame the west' lefty anyway, I've always thought that despite all its faults… https://t.co/zST5OjWKAY","No, the tweet does not contain an Ad Hominem fallacy. The user is addressing a potential stereotype or political label (""blame the west"" lefty) but does not attack the person making an argument based on their character or personal traits. Instead, the user is expressing their own perspective on the matter."
